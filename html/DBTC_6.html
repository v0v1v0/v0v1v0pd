<h2>Reduce Taxa Assignment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes a file selection and then uses all '_taxaAssign_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM.tsv'
and/or 'YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM_taxaAssignCombined.tsv' files in that directory and reduces all ASV with the same
taxonomic assignment into a single taxonomic result for each submitted file. The results are then placed in to a
'_taxaReduced_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM.tsv' file for each of the target files in the directory.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">reduce_taxa(fileLoc = NULL, numCores = 1, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fileLoc</code></td>
<td>
<p>The location of a file in a directory where all of the 'taxaAssign'
and/or 'taxaAssignCombine' files are located (Default NULL).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numCores</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cores used to run the function (Default 1,
Windows systems can only use a single core)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set to TRUE then there will be output to the R console, if
FALSE then this reporting data is suppressed (Default TRUE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function requires a file in a directory where all '_taxaAssign_YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM.tsv'
and/or 'YYYY_MM_DD_HHMM_taxaAssignCombined.tsv' files in that directory will
be combined. All records with the same taxonomic result will be combined. The
BLAST values in parentheses ("Num_Rec", "Coverage", "Identity", "Max_eVal")
are combine by the mean number of records, the mean of the minimum coverage
and identity values, and the mean of the maximum eValues.
</p>
<p>The examples are present to display the syntax for the function.
These examples are not run because there are files required to run the functions,
in some cases multiple files are necessary and some of these are quite large. To
get specific examples please see https://github.com/rgyoung6/DBTCShinyTutorial/blob/main/README.md
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function produces a 'taxa_reduced' file for every 'taxaAssign' or
'taxaAssignCombine' present in the target directory.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>WARNING - NO WHITESPACE!
</p>
<p>When running DBTC functions the paths for the files selected cannot have white
space! File folder locations should be as short as possible (close to the root
as some functions do not process long naming conventions.
</p>
<p>Also, special characters should be avoided (including question mark, number
sign, exclamation mark). It is recommended that dashes be used for separations
in naming conventions while retaining underscores for use as information
delimiters (this is how DBTC functions use underscore).
</p>
<p>There are several key character strings used in the DBTC pipeline, the presence
of these strings in file or folder names will cause errors when running DBTC functions.
</p>
<p>The following strings are those used in DBTC and should not be used in file or folder naming:
- _BLAST
- _combinedDada
- _taxaAssign
- _taxaAssignCombined
- _taxaReduced
- _CombineTaxaReduced
</p>
