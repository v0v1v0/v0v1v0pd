<h2>Operators To Check, If a Value Lies Within Or Outside a Given Range
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The between and outside operators are used to check, whether a vector of given values x lie within a defined range (or outside respectively). The values can be numbers, text or dates.
Ordered factors are supported.

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x %()% rng
x %(]% rng
x %[)% rng
x %[]% rng

x %][% rng
x %](% rng
x %)[% rng
x %)(% rng

x %:% rng
x %::% rng
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>is a variable with at least ordinal scale, usually a numeric value, but can be an ordered factor or a text as well. Texts would be treated alphabetically.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rng</code></td>
<td>

<p>a vector of two values or a matrix with 2 columns, defining the minimum and maximum of the range for x. <br> If rng is a matrix, x or rng will be recycled.

</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The "BETWEEN" operators basically combine two conditional statements into one and simplify the query process.<br>
They are merely a wrapper for:   <code>x &gt;= rng[1] &amp; x &lt;= rng[2]</code>,
where the round bracket  <code>(</code>  means <em>strictly greater (&gt;)</em> and the square bracket  <code>[</code>  means <em>greater or equal (&gt;=)</em>.  Numerical values of x will be handled by C-code, which is significantly faster than two comparisons in R (especially when x is huge).
.<br><code>%][%</code> is the negation of <code>%()%</code>, meaning all values lying outside the given range. Elements on the limits will return <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>Both arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>rng</code>, will be recycled to the highest dimension, which is either the length of the vector (<code>x</code>) or the number of rows of the matrix (<code>rng</code>).<br>
See also the routines used to check, whether two ranges overlap (<code>Overlap</code>, <code>Interval</code>).
</p>
<p><code>%:%</code> returns all the elements of a vector between the (first found) element <code>rng[1]</code> and <code>rng[2]</code>. If no match is found it returns <code>NA</code>. If <code>rng[2]</code> occurs before <code>rng[1]</code> in the vector the elements will be returned in reverse order (which is the same behaviour as the <code>:</code> operator).
<br><code>%::%</code> does the same in greedy mood. It uses the first match for <code>from</code> and the last match for <code>to</code>.
<br></p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A logical vector of the same length as x.
