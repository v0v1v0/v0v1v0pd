<h2>Generating a clone for bflSmooth_matrices_impl</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This <em>function factory</em> returns a clone of bflSmooth_matrices_impl that gives
the same results than the original function but uses cache to store computed matrices,
which is useful when making a large number of similar calls, like calls to
<code>threeRuleSmooth()</code> with the same hfserie but different lfserie,
or to <code>twoStepsBenchmark()</code> with different lfserie of the same length.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bflSmooth_matrices_factory(cache_size = 100L)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>bflSmooth_matrices_factory is only run at build time.
