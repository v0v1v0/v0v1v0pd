<h2>Delay discounting data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Delay discounting data with repeated measures for subjects across delayed outcomes.
Data were obtained from a subset of data from DeHart et al. (2020).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">examp_DD
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 360 rows and 4 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>Subject ID. Positive values are experimentally obtained.
-987.987 are median indifference points. -1 and -2 values have indifference
points of all 0 and all 1, respectively. These extra data were added for testing
and debugging to ensure that AUC calculations will result in 0 when all
indifference points are zero and 1 when all indifference points are 1.</p>
</dd>
<dt>delay_months</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delay to receiving the outcome, in months</p>
</dd>
<dt>outcome</dt>
<dd>
<p>Delayed outcome type (all were scaled to $100)</p>
</dd>
<dt>prop_indiff</dt>
<dd>
<p>Indifference point scaled to the maximum amount of each
outcome. The maximum amount was the number of servings of each outcome
worth $100.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note: The DD data shares the same indifference points used in the PD data.
The PD data were created by using the DD data and using
probabilities instead of delays. The PD was created to demonstrate features
of the discAUC package and does not represent real data.
