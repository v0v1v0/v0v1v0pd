<h2>Locally Weighted Regression for Trend and Seasonality in Equidistant Time 
Series under Short Memory</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Simultaneously estimate the trend and the 
seasonality via locally weighted regression in an equidistant time series 
under short memory. The default setting uses an iterative plug-in algorithm 
for identifying the asymptotically globally optimal bandwidth for smoothing.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">deseats(
  y,
  smoothing_options = set_options(),
  bwidth_start = NULL,
  inflation_rate = c("optimal", "naive"),
  correction_factor = FALSE,
  autocor = TRUE,
  drop = NULL,
  error_model = c("free", "ARMA"),
  nar_lim = c(0, 3),
  nma_lim = c(0, 3),
  arma_mean = FALSE
)

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>smoothing_options</code></td>
<td>
<p>an S4 object of class <code>smoothing_options</code>, which 
is returned by the function <code>set_options</code>; it

options to consider in the locally weighted regression such as the order of
polynomial and the bandwidth for smoothing among others.</p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bwidth_start</code></td>
<td>
<p>a single numeric value that is only relevant if the slot
<code>bwidth</code> in <code>smoothing_options</code> is set to <code>NA</code>; 
as the bandwidth will then
be selected automatically, <code>bwidth_start</code> sets the initial bandwidth for 
the algorithm; the default, <code>bwidth_start = NULL</code>, corresponds to 
<code>bwidth_start = 0.1</code> for a local linear trend and to 
<code>bwidth_start = 0.2</code> for a local cubic trend.</p>
</td>

<p>a character vector of length one that indicates, which inflation rate 
to use in the bandwidth selection; for a local linear trend, we have

it is <code>inflation_rate = "naive"</code>, which correspond to inflation rates
of 5/7 and 9/13, respectively.</p>

<td><code>correction_factor</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical vector of length one; theoretically, a 
larger bandwidth to estimate the sum of autocovariances from residuals of 
pilot trend and seasonality estimates is advisable than for estimating trend
and seasonality; for <code>correction_factor = TRUE</code>, this is implemented;
for <code>error_model = "ARMA"</code>, <code>correction_factor = FALSE</code> is 
enforced; the default is <code>correction_factor = FALSE</code>, because it was
found that setting this argument to <code>TRUE</code> often overestimates the 
bandwidth.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop</code></td>
<td>
<p>a numeric vector of length one that indicates the proportion of 
the observations to not include at each boundary in the bandwidth estimation 
process, if a bandwidth is selected automatically; the default is

local linear trend and to <code>drop = 0.1</code> for a local cubic trend.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Trend and seasonality are estimated based on the additive
nonparametric regression model for an equidistant time series
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">y_t = m(x_t) + s(x_t) + \epsilon_t,</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">y_t</code> is the observed time series with <code class="reqn">t=1,...n</code>, <code class="reqn">x_t = t / n</code> is the rescaled time
on the interval <code class="reqn">[0, 1]</code>, <code class="reqn">m(x_t)</code> is a smooth and deterministic
trend function, <code class="reqn">s(x_t)</code> is a (slowly changing) seasonal component with 
seasonal period <code class="reqn">p_s</code> and <code class="reqn">\epsilon_t</code> are stationary errors 
with <code class="reqn">E(\epsilon_t) = 0</code> and short-range dependence (see for example also 
Feng, 2013, for a similar model, where the stochastic term is however i.i.d.).
</p>
<p>It is assumed that <code class="reqn">m</code> and <code class="reqn">s</code> can be approximated locally by a polynomial of
small order and by a trigonometric polynomial, respectively. Through locally
weighted regression, <code class="reqn">m</code> and <code class="reqn">s</code> can therefore be estimated given 
a suitable bandwidth.
</p>
<p>The iterative-plug-in (IPI) algorithm, which numerically minimizes the
asymptotic mean squared error (AMISE) to select a bandwidth is 
an extension of Feng (2013) to the case with short-range dependence in the 
errors. To achieve this goal, the error variance in the AMISE in Feng (2013) 
is replaced by the sum of autocovariances of the error process and this 
quantity is being estimated using a slightly adjusted version of the 
Bühlmann (1996) algorithm. This procedure is similar to the method described 
in Feng, Gries and Fritz (2020), 
where data-driven local polynomial regression with an automatically selected 
bandwidth is used to estimate the trend according to a model without 
seasonality and where the same adjusted Bühlmann (1996) algorithm is 
considered to estimate the sum of autocovariances in the error process.
</p>
<p>Define <code class="reqn">I[m^{(k)}] = \int_{c_b}^{d_b} [m^{(k)}(x)]^2 dx</code>, <code class="reqn">\beta_{(k)} = \int_{-1}^{1} u^k
K(u) du</code>
and <code class="reqn">R(K) = \int_{-1}^{1} K^{2}(u) du</code>, where <code class="reqn">p</code> is the order of the (local) polynomial 
considered for <code class="reqn">m</code>,
<code class="reqn">k = p + 1</code> is the order of the asymptotically equivalent kernel <code class="reqn">K</code> 
for estimating <code class="reqn">m</code>, <code class="reqn">0 \leq c_{b}&lt; d_{b} \leq 1</code>, and
<code class="reqn">c_f</code> is the variance factor, i.e. the sum of autocovariances divided by 
<code class="reqn">2\pi</code>.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, we define
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">C_{1} = \frac{I[m^{(k)}] \beta_{(k)}^2}{(k!)^2}</code>
</p>

<p>and
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">C_{2} = \frac{2 \pi c_{f} (d_b - c_b)[R(K) + (p_s - 1) R(W)]}{nh}</code>
</p>

<p>with <code class="reqn">h</code> being the bandwidth, <code class="reqn">n</code> being the number of
observations and <code class="reqn">W</code> being the weighting function considered in the 
weighted least squares approach, for example a second-order kernel function 
with support on <code class="reqn">[-1,1]</code>. The AMISE is then
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">AMISE(h) = h^{2k}C_{1} + C_{2}.</code>
</p>

<p>The function calculates suitable estimates for <code class="reqn">c_f</code>, the variance
factor, and <code class="reqn">I[m^{(k)}]</code> over different iterations. In each
iteration, a bandwidth is obtained in accordance with the AMISE that once
more serves as an input for the following iteration. The process repeats
until either convergence or the 40th iteration is reached. For further
details on the asymptotic theory or the algorithm, please consult Feng,
Gries and Fritz (2020) or Feng et al. (2019).
</p>
<p>To apply the function, only few arguments are needed: a data input <code>y</code>,
an object with smoothing options <code>smoothing_options</code> returned by 
<code>set_options</code> and 
a starting value for the relative bandwidth
<code>bwidth_start</code>. Aside from <code>y</code>, each argument has a default setting.
By default, a local linear trend is considered. In some cases, a local cubic 
trend may, however, be more suitable. For more specific information on the input arguments
consult the section <em>Arguments</em>.
</p>
<p>When applying the function, an optimal bandwidth is obtained based on the
IPI algorithm proposed by Feng, Gries and Fritz (2020). In a second step,
the nonparametric trend of the series and the seasonality are calculated with 
respect to the chosen bandwidth.
</p>
<p>Note that with this function <code class="reqn">m(x_t)</code> and <code class="reqn">s(x_t)</code> can be 
estimated without a parametric
model assumption for the error series. Thus, after estimating and removing
the trend and the seasonality, any suitable parametric model, e.g. an 
ARMA(<code class="reqn">p,q</code>) model for <code>errors = "autocor"</code>, can be fitted to the 
residuals (see <code>arima</code>).
</p>
<p>Usually, a local cubic trend (<code>smoothing_options = set_options(order_poly = 3)</code>)
gives more suitable results. Moreover, if the resulting bandwidth is too large, 
adjustments to the arguments <code>inflation_rate</code> and <code>drop</code> should be
tried first in that order before any other changes 
to the input arguments.
</p>
<p>The default print method for this function delivers key numbers such as the 
bandwidth considered for smoothing.
</p>
<p>NOTE:
</p>
<p>This function implements C++ code by means
of the <code>Rcpp</code> and
<code>RcppArmadillo</code> packages for
better performance.
