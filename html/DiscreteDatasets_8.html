<h2>Disorder Detection data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For earlier recognition of diseases, multiple variations of the human base
sequence get studied. The so-called coverage of each base is calculated to
detect duplicates, deletions and insertions in the base sequence. To find
these variations a hypothesis-test gets performed for each base in the tested
area. The null-hypothesis being that the coverage of the base is as expected
under the null-hypothesis (expected coverage Cb can be calculated using a
given formula, following a poisson distribution). If the observed coverage is
exceptionally high or low the null-hypothesis gets rejected. For each type of
variation there is a different formula to calculate the expected coverages.
The expected coverages in this data set were calculated using the formula for
a local test without GC-correction.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("disorderdetection")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 315 rows representing a base sequence with the
following 2 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>observed frequencies</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Observed coverage of each base</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>expected frequencies</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Expected coverage of each base</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data was collected from the "Goodness-of-fit tests for disorder detection
in NGS experiments" published by the Biometrical Journal , by Jiménez-Otero,
de Uña-Álvarez and Pardo-Fernández. See references for more details.
