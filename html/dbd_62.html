Visual recognition data.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Counts of successes in visual recognition memory for large and
small binary pictures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("visRecog")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 30 observations on the following 4 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>deck</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector indicating which of two
decks of cards, bearing graphic images, was used in the
given experiment.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>subject</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector indexing the (human)
subjects in the experiments.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tot5</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector whose entries are counts
of successes when the cards used consist of a
<code class="reqn">5 \times 5</code> grid of “facets”.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tot10</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>An integer vector whose entries are counts
of successes when the cards used consist of a
<code class="reqn">10 \times 10</code> grid of “facets”.
</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Adult subjects were shown a series of cards, each bearing a
simple graphic image.  Each image resembled one face of a Rubik's
cube, formed of either a 5x5 or a 10x10 grid of facets, each facet
being either black or white.  Later, each subject was shown a
series of 20 similar cards, exactly 10 of which had been shown to
the subject previously.  The subject's task was to identify each
image as a new one, or as a previously seen one.  The response
variable <code>tot5</code> is the number of correct identifications,
out of 20, for the <code class="reqn">5 \times 5</code> cards.  Similarly the
variable <code>tot10</code> is the number of correct identifications for
the <code class="reqn">10 \times 10</code> cards.
</p>
<p>Subjects 21–30 were (deliberately) tested with a different set of
cards than subjects 1–20, to ensure that results were not a function
of the original deck of cards.  (This seems to have no actual relevance.)
