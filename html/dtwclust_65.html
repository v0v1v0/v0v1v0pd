<h2>Soft-DTW distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Soft-DTW distance measure as proposed in Cuturi and Blondel (2017).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">sdtw(x, y, gamma = 0.01, ..., error.check = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
<p>Time series. Multivariate series must have time spanning the rows and variables
spanning the columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>Positive regularization parameter, with lower values resulting in less smoothing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Currently ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>error.check</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical indicating whether the function should try to detect inconsistencies
and give more informative errors messages. Also used internally to avoid repeating checks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Unlike other distances, soft-DTW can return negative values, and <code>sdtw(x, x)</code> is not always equal
to zero. Like DTW, soft-DTW does not fulfill the triangle inequality, but it is always symmetric.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The Soft DTW distance.
</p>


<h3>Proxy version</h3>

<p>The version registered with <code>proxy::dist()</code> is custom (<code>loop = FALSE</code> in proxy::pr_DB).
The custom function handles multi-threaded parallelization directly with RcppParallel.
It uses all available threads by default (see <code>RcppParallel::defaultNumThreads()</code>),
but this can be changed by the user with <code>RcppParallel::setThreadOptions()</code>.
</p>
<p>An exception to the above is when it is called within a <code>foreach</code> parallel loop <strong>made by dtwclust</strong>.
If the parallel workers do not have the number of threads explicitly specified,
this function will default to 1 thread per worker.
See the parallelization vignette for more information - <code>browseVignettes("dtwclust")</code>
</p>
<p>It also includes symmetric optimizations to calculate only half a distance matrix when appropriate—only one list of series should be provided in <code>x</code>.
Starting with version 6.0.0, this optimization means that the function returns an array with the lower triangular values of the distance matrix,
similar to what <code>stats::dist()</code> does;
see DistmatLowerTriangular for a helper to access elements as it if were a normal matrix.
If you want to avoid this optimization, call proxy::dist by giving the same list of series in both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that, due to the fact that this distance is not always zero when a series is compared
against itself, this optimization is likely problematic for soft-DTW, as the <code>dist</code> object will
be handled by many functions as if it had only zeroes in the diagonal. An exception is
<code>tsclust()</code> when using partitional clustering with PAM centroids—actual diagonal values will
be calculated and considered internally in that case.
