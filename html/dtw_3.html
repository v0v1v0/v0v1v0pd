<h2>ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms, 3a and 3b</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ANSI/AAMI EC13 Test Waveforms 3a and 3b, as obtained from the PhysioBank
database.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Time-series objects (class <code>ts</code>).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following text is reproduced (abridged) from PhysioBank, page
<a href="https://www.physionet.org/content/aami-ec13/1.0.0/">https://www.physionet.org/content/aami-ec13/1.0.0/</a>.  Other
recordings belong to the dataset and can be obtained from the same page.
</p>
<p>The files in this set can be used for testing a variety of devices that
monitor the electrocardiogram.  The recordings include both synthetic and
real waveforms. For details on these test waveforms and how to use them,
please refer to section 5.1.2.1, paragraphs (e) and (g) in the reference
below.  Each recording contains one ECG signal sampled at 720 Hz with 12-bit
resolution.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Timestamps in the datasets have been re-created at the indicated
frequency of 720 Hz, whereas the original timestamps in ms (at least in text
format) only had three decimal digits' precision, and were therefore
affected by substantial jittering.
