<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The three inductive item tree analysis algorithms are exploratory
methods for extracting quasi orders (surmise relations) from data.
In each algorithm, competing binary relations are generated (in the
same way for all three versions), and a fit measure (differing from
version to version) is computed for every relation of the selection
set in order to find the quasi order that fits the data best.  In
all three algorithms, the idea is to estimate the numbers of
counterexamples for each quasi order, and to find, over all
competing quasi orders, the minimum value for the discrepancy
between the observed and expected numbers of counterexamples.  The
three data analysis methods differ in their choices of estimates for
the expected numbers of counterexamples.  For details see
<code>iita</code>.  The algorithms are described in the paper about
the <span class="pkg">DAKS</span> package by <cite>Uenlue and Sargin (2010)</cite>, and in
the paper by <cite>Sargin and Uenlue (2009)</cite>.
</p>
<p>Compared to <code>iita</code>, the function <code>pop_iita</code>
implements the three inductive item tree analysis algorithms in
population, <b>not</b> sample, quantities.  The argument <code>imp</code>
must give a quasi order, and equipped with the error probabilities
<code>ce</code> and <code>lg</code>, it is considered a special case of the
basic local independence model (<cite>Doignon and Falmagne, 1999</cite>).
The latter then is considered as the underlying population model.
If <code>dataset = NULL</code> a set of competing quasi orders is
constructed based on a population analog of the inductive generation
procedure implemented in sample quantities in <code>ind_gen</code>.
If a dataset is specified explicitly, that data are used to generate
the set of competing quasi orders based on the sample version of the
inductive generation procedure.
</p>
<p>A set of implications, an object of the class
<code>set</code>, consists of <code class="reqn">2</code>-tuples <code class="reqn">(i, j)</code> of
the class <code>tuple</code>, where a <code class="reqn">2</code>-tuple
<code class="reqn">(i, j)</code> is interpreted as 'mastering item <code class="reqn">j</code> implies
mastering item <code class="reqn">i</code>.'
</p>
<p>The data (in <code>dataset</code>) must contain only ones and zeros, which
encode solving or failing to solve an item, respectively.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If the arguments <code>imp</code>, <code>ce</code>, <code>lg</code>, <code>items</code>,
<code>dataset</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>v</code> are of required types,
<code>pop_iita</code> returns a named list consisting of the following five
components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop.diff</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector giving the population <em>diff</em> values
corresponding to the (inductively generated) competing quasi
orders (subject to selected version that was performed).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pop.matrix</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix of all possible response patterns and
their corresponding population occurrence probabilities.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>error.pop</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the population <code class="reqn">\gamma</code>
rates corresponding to the (inductively generated) competing quasi
orders (subject to selected version that was performed).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>selection.set</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list of the (inductively generated) competing
quasi orders.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>v</code></td>
<td>
<p>the version used; <code>v = 1</code> (minimized corrected),
<code>v = 2</code> (corrected), and <code>v = 3</code> (original).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The single careless error <code>ce</code> and lucky guess <code>lg</code>
probabilities are assumed to be constant over all items.  The most
general case that can be specified thus includes two error
probabilities, which are the same for all items.
</p>
<p>The sample <em>diff</em> coefficients of the three inductive item tree
analysis algorithms can be transformed into maximum likelihood
estimators, by division through the square of sample size.  These
transformed <em>diff</em> coefficients are considered in population
quantities.  The <code class="reqn">\gamma</code> rates are the algorithms'
specific estimates of the postulated response error probability.
</p>
<p>Population and estimated asymptotic variances of the maximum
likelihood estimators <em>diff</em> are implemented in the functions
<code>pop_variance</code> and <code>variance</code>, respectively.
