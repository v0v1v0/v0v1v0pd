<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Phone numbers are often represented as strings because there is no obvious and suitable native representation for them. This leads to high memory use and a lack of standard representation. The package provides integer representation of Australian phone numbers with optional raw vector calling code. The package name is an extension of 'au' and 'ph'.
