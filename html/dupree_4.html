<h2>Detect code duplication between the code-blocks in a set of files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function identifies all code-blocks in a set of files and then computes
a similarity score between those code-blocks to help identify functions /
classes that have a high level of duplication, and could possibly be
refactored.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dupree(files, min_block_size = 40, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>files</code></td>
<td>
<p>A set of files over which code-duplication
should be measured.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min_block_size</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>dupree</code> uses a notion of non-trivial
symbols.  These are the symbols / code-words that remain after filtering
out really common symbols like <code>&lt;-</code>, <code>,</code>, etc. After filtering
out these symbols from each code-block, only those blocks containing at
least <code>min_block_size</code> symbols are used in the inter-block
code-duplication measurement.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Code-blocks under a size threshold are disregarded before analysis (the size
threshold is controlled by <code>min_block_size</code>); and only top-level code
blocks are considered.
</p>
<p>Every sufficiently large code-block in the input files will be present in
the results at least once. If code-block X and code-block Y are present in
a row of the resulting data-frame, then either X is the closest match to Y,
or Y is the closest match to X (or possibly both) according to the
similarity score; as such, some code-blocks may be present multiple times in
the results.
</p>
<p>Similarity between code-blocks is calculated using the
longest-common-subsequence (<code>lcs</code>) measure from the package
<code>stringdist</code>. This measure is applied to a tokenised version of the
code-blocks. That is, each function name / operator / variable in the code
blocks is converted to a unique integer so that a code-block can be
represented as a vector of integers and the <code>lcs</code> measure is applied to
each pair of these vectors.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>tibble</code>. Each row in the table summarises the
comparison between two code-blocks (block 'a' and block 'b') in the input
files. Each code-block in the pair is indicated by: i) the file
(<code>file_a</code> / <code>file_b</code>) that contains it; ii) its position within
that file (<code>block_a</code> / <code>block_b</code>; 1 being the first code-block in
a given file); and iii) the line where that code-block starts in that file
(<code>line_a</code> / <code>line_b</code>). The pairs of code-blocks are ordered by
decreasing similarity. Any match that is returned is either the top hit for
block 'a' or for block 'b' (or both).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># To quantify duplication between the top-level code-blocks in a file
example_file &lt;- system.file("extdata", "duplicated.R", package = "dupree")
dup &lt;- dupree(example_file, min_block_size = 10)
dup

# For the block-pair with the highest duplication, we print the first four
# lines:
readLines(example_file)[dup$line_a[1] + c(0:3)]
readLines(example_file)[dup$line_b[1] + c(0:3)]

# The code-blocks in the example file are rather small, so if
# `min_block_size` is too large, none of the code-blocks will be analysed
# and the results will be empty:
dupree(example_file, min_block_size = 40)
</code></pre>
