<h2>Cophenetic correlation between two trees</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cophenetic correlation coefficient for two trees.
</p>
<p>Assumes the labels in the two trees fully match. If they do not
please first use intersect_trees to have them matched.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cor_cophenetic(dend1, ...)

## Default S3 method:
cor_cophenetic(
  dend1,
  dend2,
  method_coef = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"),
  ...
)

## S3 method for class 'dendlist'
cor_cophenetic(
  dend1,
  which = c(1L, 2L),
  method_coef = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"),
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dend1</code></td>
<td>
<p>a tree (dendrogram/hclust/phylo, or dendlist)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Ignored.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dend2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Either a tree (dendrogram/hclust/phylo), or a dist object (for example, from the original data matrix).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method_coef</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string indicating which correlation coefficient
is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman",
can be abbreviated. Passed to cor.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>which</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer vector of length 2, indicating
which of the trees in a dendlist object should have
their cor_cophenetic calculated.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>From cophenetic:
The cophenetic distance between two observations that have been clustered
is defined to be the intergroup dissimilarity at which the two observations
are first combined into a single cluster. Note that this distance has many
ties and restrictions.
</p>
<p>cor_cophenetic calculates the correlation between two cophenetic distance
matrices of the two trees.
</p>
<p>The value can range between -1 to 1. With near 0 values meaning that
the two trees are not statistically similar.
For exact p-value one should result to a permutation test. One such option
will be to permute over the labels of one tree many times, and calculating
the distriubtion under the null hypothesis (keeping the trees topologies
constant).
</p>
<p>Notice that this measure IS affected by the height of a branch.

ss &lt;- sample(1:150, 10)
hc1 &lt;- iris[ss, -5] %&gt;%
  dist() %&gt;%
  hclust("com")

#    cutree(dend1)

cophenetic(hc1)
cophenetic(hc2)
# notice how the dist matrix for the dendrograms have different orders:
cophenetic(dend1)
cophenetic(dend2)

cor(cophenetic(hc1), cophenetic(hc2)) # 0.874
cor(cophenetic(dend1), cophenetic(dend2)) # 0.16
# the difference is becasue the order of the distance table in the case of
# stats:::cophenetic.dendrogram will change between dendrograms!

# however, this is consistant (since I force-sort the rows/columns):
cor_cophenetic(hc1, hc2)
cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2)

cor_cophenetic(dendlist(dend1, dend2))

# we can also use different cor methods (almost the same result though):
cor_cophenetic(hc1, hc2, method = "spearman") # 0.8456014
cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2, method = "spearman") #


# cophenetic correlation is about 10 times (!) faster than bakers_gamma cor:
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(
  cor_bakers_gamma = cor_bakers_gamma(dend1, dend2, try_cutree_hclust = FALSE),
  cor_cophenetic = cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2),
  times = 10
)

# but only because of the cutree for dendrogram. When allowing hclust cutree
# it is only about twice as fast:
microbenchmark(
  cor_bakers_gamma = cor_bakers_gamma(dend1, dend2, try_cutree_hclust = TRUE),
  cor_cophenetic = cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2),
  times = 10
