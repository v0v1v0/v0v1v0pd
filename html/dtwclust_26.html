<h2>DTW distance with L2 norm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Wrapper for the <code>dtw::dtw()</code> function using L2 norm for both the local cost matrix (LCM) creation
as well as the final cost aggregation step.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dtw2(x, y, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x, y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A time series. A multivariate series should have time spanning the rows and variables
spanning the columns.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Further arguments for <code>dtw::dtw()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The L-norms are used in two different steps by the DTW algorithm. First when creating the LCM,
where the element <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> of the matrix is computed as the L-norm of <code class="reqn">x^v_i - y^v_j</code> for
all variables <code class="reqn">v</code>. Note that this means that, in case of multivariate series, they must have
the same number of variables, and that univariate series will produce the same LCM regardless of
the L-norm used. After the warping path is found by DTW, the final distance is calculated as the
L-norm of all <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> elements of the LCM that fall on the warping path.
</p>
<p>The <code>dtw::dtw()</code> function allows changing the norm by means of its <code>dist.method</code> parameter, but
it only uses it when creating the LCM, and not when calculating the final aggregated cost, i.e.
the DTW distance.
</p>
<p>This wrapper simply returns the appropriate DTW distance using L2 norm (Euclidean norm). A
<code>proxy::dist()</code> version is also registered.
</p>
<p>The windowing constraint uses a centered window.
The calculations expect a value in <code>window.size</code> that represents the distance between the point considered and one of the edges of the window.
Therefore, if, for example, <code>window.size = 10</code>, the warping for an observation <code class="reqn">x_i</code> considers the points between <code class="reqn">x_{i-10}</code> and <code class="reqn">x_{i+10}</code>,
resulting in <code>10(2) + 1 = 21</code> observations falling within the window.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>dtw</code>.
