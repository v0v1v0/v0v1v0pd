<h2>DGEobj Package Overview</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>DGEobj is an S3 data class that provides a flexible container for Differential Gene
Expression (DGE) analysis results.  The DGEobj class is designed to be extensible
allowing definition of new data types as needed. A set of accessory functions to
deposit, query and retrieve subsets of a data workflow has been provided.  Attributes
are used to capture metadata such as species and gene model, including reproducibility
information such that a 3rd party can access a DGEobj history to see how each data
object was created or modified.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Operationally, the DGEobj is influenced by the RangedSummarizedExperiment (RSE).
The DGEobj has data slots for row (gene), col (samples), assays (anything with n-rows
by m-samples dimensions) and metadata (anything that can't be keyed to row, col or
assay).  The key motivation for creating the DGEobj data structure is that the RSE
only allows one data item each in the row and col slots and thus is unsuitable for
capturing the plethora of data objects created during a typical DGE workflow.   The
DGEobj data structure can hold any number of row and col data objects and thus is
suitable for capturing the multiple steps of a downstream analysis.
</p>
<p>Certain object types, primarily the count matrix and associated row and column info,
are defined as unique which means only one instance of that type may be added to
the DGEobj.
</p>
<p>When multiple objects of one type are included in a DGEobj (e.g. two different fits),
the concept of parent attributes is used to associate downstream data objects (e.g.
contrasts) with the appropriate data object they are derived from.
