<h2>Data from German cities before and after the Second World War</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is part of the data used by Redding and Sturm (2008) to study the impact of market access on economic development in West German cities after the division of Germany after the Second World War.
There are 119 rows corresponding to different cities and 21 columns that stand for different variables.
These variables are: one treatment indicator, 15 baseline covariates, and five outcomes.
Treated cities are those West German cities within 75 kilometers of the border between East and West Germany after the Second World War (see Redding and Sturm (2008) for details).
The complete dataset is available at <a href="http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.5.1766">http://www.aeaweb.org/articles.php?doi=10.1257/aer.98.5.1766</a>.
