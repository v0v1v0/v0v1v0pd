<h2>DeponsDyn-class</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Stores objects containing population dynamics output and energetic
output simulated using the DEPONS model.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The following columns are included in the simulation output data
frame: 'tick', which indicates the number of half-hourly time steps since the
start of the simulation; 'count', which indicates the population size at a
given time; 'anim.e', showing the average amount of energy stored by simulated
animals; 'lands.e', which shows the total amount of energy in the landscape,
and 'real.time' which shows the time relative to 'startday'.
</p>


<h3>Slots</h3>


<dl>
<dt><code>title</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Name of the object or simulation</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>landscape</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Character. Identifier for the landscape used in the DEPONS
simulations. The landscapes 'DanTysk', 'Gemini', 'Kattegat', 'North Sea',
'Homogeneous', and 'User defined' are distributed with the DEPONS model.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>simtime</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>POSIXlt</code> object with the date and time when the
simulation was finished. This is read from the name of the imput file.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>startday</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>POSIXlt object with the first day of the simulation, i.e.
the first day in the period that the simulations are intended to represent in
the real world.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>dyn</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Data frame with simulation output.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Note</h3>

<p>DeponsDyn-objects are usually read in from csv files produced during
DEPONS simulations. These files are named 'Statistics.XXX.csv', where XXX
indicates the date and time when the simulation was finished.
