<h2>Annual water level behind the
high dam during the flood time
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function allows to provide the annual water level behind the
high dam during the flood time from 1980 to 2010. The
highest water level of the dam is 182 meters (m) above the
mean sea level.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data set consists of the annual water level behind the
high dam during the flood time from 1980 to 2010. The
highest water level of the dam is 182 meters (m) above the
mean sea level. Recently, it is used by Khalid and Aslam (2021) and fitted unit Lindley mixture model.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data_floodtime gives the annual water level behind the
high dam during the flood time from 1980 to 2010.
