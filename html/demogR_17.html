<h2> Leslie Matrix </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates a Leslie matrix for demographic projection from vectors of
age-specific cumulative survival and fertility.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">leslie.matrix(lx, mx, 
		    L = TRUE, 
		    peryear = 5, 
		    one.sex = TRUE, 
		    SRB = 1.05, 
		    infant.class = TRUE) 
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

 
<p>Constructs a k x k age-classified demographic projection matrix with
age-specific survival probabilities along the sub-diagonal and
age-specific fertilities along the first row of the
matrix. 
</p>
<p><code>lx</code> and <code>mx</code> are assumed to be of the same
length.  The resulting matrix is truncated to insure that there are
no post-reproductive classes.  This is important for ensuring
irreducibility of the resulting matrix.
</p>
<p>If <code>mx</code> is longer than <code>lx</code>, <code>mx</code> is trucated to be
the same length as <code>lx</code>.  If <code>lx</code> is longer than
<code>mx</code>, a warning is issed and <code>lx</code> is truncated to be the
same length as <code>mx</code>.
</p>
<p>Fertility is assumed to be birth-flow (Caswell 2001).  That is,
breeding is assumed to be continuous and the individual elements of
the first row of the Leslie matrix are averaged over successive
age-classes.  Fertility rates are typically given in annualized
form.  If this is the case and the age-classes are wider than one
year, then <code>peryear</code> can be used to appropriately scale up the
annual values.
</p>
<p>The default behavior is to use person-years lived in the interval as
the survival measure.   If <code>infant.class=TRUE</code>, lx is taken to
have a value for the infant age class (i.e., a shorter class width
than the other elements of <code>lx</code>.  What is done when there is an
infant class depends on what the values in <code>lx</code> represent. If
<code>L=TRUE</code>, then the first two values of lx are combined to form
the total person-years for the first age-class in the Leslie
matrix.  Human demographic data from abridged life tables typically
come with age classes x = 0, 1, 5, 10, ... Thus, combining the
person-years for the first two age classes gives an initial age
class of the correct width. If <code>infant.class=TRUE</code> and
<code>L=FALSE</code>, the second element of <code>lx</code> is deleted.
Creating a Leslie matrix from other forms of non-standard early
age-classes can be accomplished by pre-processing <code>lx</code> and
using the option <code>infant.class=FALSE</code>.
</p>
<p>The human sex ratio at birth (male births/female births) is
remarkably close to SRB=1.05 across a wide range of populations and
this is the default value for <code>SRB</code>.
</p>
<p>The resulting matrix has class "leslie.matrix". This class is
not used extensively but will be in future development.
