<h2>estimate remaining life expectancy in the open age group</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This calculation is based on an indirect method to reference the Coale-Demeny West model life table. First one makes a pseudo life table deaths column using some stable pop assumptions (different in SEG vs GGB-SEG). Then take the ratio of the sum of ages 10-39 to 40-59. These ratios have been worked out for each model life table level, so we can pick the level based on the ratio we produce from the data. From there, we just pick out the remaining life expectancy that corresponds to the top age in our data, which for now hopefully is not higher than 95. The model life tables do not go higher than 95 for now, but that's well beyond the range for this method family. If your data go beyond 85 or so, then just group down to 85, say, and estimate using that instead of keeping a high open age. Called by <code>segMakeColumns()</code> and <code>ggbsegMakeColumns()</code>, and not intended for direct user interface, because you need to produce the <code>$deathsLT</code> column. You can skip calling this function by specifying <code>eOpen</code> in the top call to <code>seg()</code> or <code>ggbseg()</code>.
