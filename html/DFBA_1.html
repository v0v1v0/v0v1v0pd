<h2>DFBA: Distribution-Free Bayesian Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of functions to perform distribution-free Bayesian analyses. Included are Bayesian analogues to the frequentist Mann-Whitney U test, the Wilcoxon Signed-Ranks test, Kendall's Tau Rank Correlation Coefficient, Goodman and Kruskal's Gamma, McNemar's Test, the binomial test, the sign test, the median test, as well as distribution-free methods for testing contrasts among condition and for computing Bayes factors for hypotheses. The package also includes procedures to estimate the power of distribution-free Bayesian tests based on data simulations using various probability models for the data. The set of functions provide data analysts with a set of Bayesian procedures that avoids requiring parametric assumptions about measurement error and is robust to problem of extreme outlier scores.
