<h2>Specify Vaccination Variables and Entry Time</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used in the model statements of dove() and dove2() to specify
the vaccination time, vaccination status, and entry time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">vaccine(entry_time, vaccination_status, vaccination_time)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>entry_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the time when 
the participant enters the trial. Entry times must be
non-negative and complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccination_status</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable indicating the vaccination 
status: 1 = vaccinated; 0 = not vaccinated. Vaccination status
must be binary, integer (or be able to be cast as integer without
loss of information), and complete.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccination_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>The variable for the time when 
vaccination takes place. Vaccination time must be non-negative for
vaccinated participants and can be
any non-negative value, NA or Inf if a participant was not 
vaccinated during the trial.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For participants that were vaccinated, times must obey
entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> vaccination_time. If a case is
found to violate this relationship, its entry_time is set to NA
and it is removed from the analysis.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function is intended to be used only in the model statements 
of dove() and dove2(). The result, a matrix, is used internally.
