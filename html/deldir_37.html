<h2>
Produce matrix of triangle vertex indices.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists the indices of the vertices of each Delaunay triangle in
the triangulation of a planar point set.  The indices are listed
(in increasing numeric order) as the rows of an <code class="reqn">n \times 3</code>
matrix where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number of Delaunay triangles in the
triangulation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">triMat(object)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>An object of class <code>deldir</code> (as produced by the function
<code>deldir()</code>) specifying the Delaunay triangulation
and Dirichlet (Voronoi) tessellation of a planar point set.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function was suggested by Robin Hankin of the School of
Mathematical and Computing Sciences at Auckland University of
Technology.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An <code class="reqn">n \times 3</code> matrix where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number
of Delaunay triangles in the triangulation specified by <code>object</code>.
The <code class="reqn">i^{th}</code> row consists of the indices (in the original
list of points being triangulated) of vertices of the <code class="reqn">i^{th}</code>
Delaunay triangle.  The indices are listed in increasing numeric
order in each row.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Earlier versions of this function (prior to release 0.1-14
of <b>deldir</b>) could sometimes give incorrect results.
This happened if the union of three contiguous Delaunay triangles
happened to constitute another triangle.  This latter triangle
would appear in the list of triangles produced by <code>triMat()</code>
but is <em>not</em> itself a Delaunay triangle.  The updated version
of <code>triMat()</code> now checks for this possibility and gives
(<em>I think!</em>) correct results.
</p>
<p>Many thanks to Jay Call, who pointed out this bug to me.
