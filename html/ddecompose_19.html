<h2>Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>ob_decompose</code> implements the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition that
divides differences in the mean outcome between two groups into one part explained
by different covariate means (composition effect) and into another part due to
differences in linear regression coefficients linking covariates to the outcome
variable (structure effect).
</p>
<p>The function allows for 'doubly robust' decompositions where the sample of one
group is reweighted such that it matches the covariates distribution of the
other group before the regression coefficients are estimated.
</p>
<p>For distributional statistics beyond the mean, the function performs the RIF
regression decomposition proposed by Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2018).
</p>

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>formula</code> object with an outcome variable Y on the left-hand side
and the covariates X on the right-hand side. If <code>reweighting = TRUE</code>, the same
covariates are used to estimate the conditional probabilities for the reweighting factor.
A different model for estimating the conditional probabilities can be defined
after a <code>|</code> operator on the right-hand side.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing the variables in the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>group</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the a binary variable (numeric or factor)
identifying the two groups that will be compared. The group identified by the
lower ranked value in 'group' (i.e., 0 in the case of a dummy variable or the
first level of factor variable) is defined as group 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of non-negative observation weights, hence of same length as <code>dep_var</code>.
The default (<code>NULL</code>) is equivalent to <code>weights = rep(1, length(dep_var))</code>.
If no weights are used, make sure you do not define this parameter (e.g. with <code>weights = NULL</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reweighting</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: if 'TRUE', then the decomposition is performed with
with respect to reweighted reference group yielding either a 'doubly robust'
Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition or a reweighted RIF decomposition.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>normalize_factors</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: If 'TRUE', then factor variables are normalized as
proposed by Gardeazabal/Ugidos (2004) and results are not dependent on the factor's
reference group. Per default (<code>normalize_factors  = FALSE</code>) and factors are not
normalized.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reference_0</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: if 'TRUE' (default), then the group 0 – i.e.,
the group identified by the lower ranked value in 'group' – will be defined
as reference group. The reference group will be reweighted to match the
covariates distribution of the counterfactual sample.
By default, the composition effect is computed as <code>(X1 - X0) * b0</code> and
the structure effect as <code>X1 * (b1 - b0)</code>. Putting <code>reference_0 = FALSE</code> changes
the reference structure. Hence, the composition effect is computed as <code>(X1 - X0) * b1</code> and
the structure effect as <code>X0 * (b1 - b0)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subtract_1_from_0</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: By default ('FALSE'), X0 is subtracted from X1 and beta0 from beta1 (X1b1 - X0b0)
to compute the overall difference. Setting 'subtract_1_from_0' to 'TRUE' merely changes the sign of the decomposition results.
This means the composition effect is computed as <code>(X0 - X1) * b1</code> and
the structure effect as <code>X0 * (b0 - b1)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>reweighting_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>specifies the method fit and predict conditional probabilities
used to derive the reweighting factor. Currently, <code>"logit"</code>, <code>"fastglm"</code>,
and <code>"random_forest"</code> are available.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trimming</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: If <code>TRUE</code>, observations with dominant reweighting factor
values are trimmend according to rule of Huber, Lechner, and Wunsch (2013). Per
default, trimming is set to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trimming_threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric: threshold defining the maximal accepted
relative weight of the reweighting factor value (i.e., inverse probability weight)
of a single observation. If <code>NULL</code>, the threshold is set to <code class="reqn">sqrt(N)/N</code>,
where <code class="reqn">N</code> is the number of observations in the reference group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rifreg_statistic</code></td>
<td>
<p>string containing the distributional statistic for which to compute the RIF.
If 'NULL' (default), no RIF regression decomposition is computed.
If an available statistic is selected, 'ob_decompose' estimates a RIF regression decomposition.
The 'rifreg_statistic' can be one of
"quantiles", "mean", "variance", "gini", "interquantile_range", "interquantile_ratio", or "custom".
If "custom" is selected, a <code>custom_rif_function</code> needs to be provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rifreg_probs</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of length 1 or more with probabilities of quantiles. Each quantile is indicated with a value between 0 and 1.
Default is <code>c(1:9)/10</code>. If <code>statistic = "quantiles"</code>, a single RIF regression for every quantile in <code>probs</code>
is estimated. An interquantile ratio (range) is defined by the ratio (difference) between the <code>max(probs)</code>-quantile and
the <code>min(probs)</code>-quantile.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>custom_rif_function</code></td>
<td>
<p>the RIF function to compute the RIF of the custom distributional statistic.
Default is NULL. Only needs to be provided if <code>statistic = "custom"</code>.
Every custom_rif_function needs the parameters <code>dep_var</code>, <code>weights</code> and <code>probs</code>.
If they are not needed, they must be set to NULL in the function definition (e.g. <code>probs = NULL</code>).
A custom function must return a data frame containing at least a "rif" and "weights" column.
See <code>examples</code> for further details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.action</code></td>
<td>
<p>generic function that defines how NAs in the data should be handled.
Default is <code>na.omit</code>, leading to exclusion of observations that contain one or more missings.
See na.action for further details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: If 'FALSE' (default), then no bootstrapped standard
errors are calculated and, in the case of a standard Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition,
analytical standard errors are estimated (assuming independence between groups).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap_iterations</code></td>
<td>
<p>positive integer indicating the number of bootstrap
iterations to execute. Only required if <code>bootstrap = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap_robust</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean: if 'FALSE' (default), then bootstrapped standard
errors are estimated as the standard deviations of the bootstrapp estimates.
Otherwise, the function uses the bootstrap interquartile range rescaled by the
interquantile range of the standard distribution to estimate standard errors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cluster</code></td>
<td>
<p>numeric vector of same length as <code>dep_var</code> indicating the
clustering of observations. If <code>cluster = NULL</code> (default), no clustering
is a assumend and bootstrap procedure resamples individual observations. Otherwise
bootstrap procedure resamples clusters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>positive integer indicating the number of cores to use when
computing bootstrap standard errors. Only required if <code>bootstrap = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vcov</code></td>
<td>
<p>function estimating covariance matrix of regression coefficients if
standard errors are not bootstrapped (i.e., <code>bootstrap = FALSE</code>). By default,
vcov is used assuming homoscedastic errors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>additional parameters passed to the custom_rif_function.
Apart from dep_var, weights and probs they must have a different name than the the ones in rifreg.
For instance, if you want to pass a parameter statistic to the custom_rif_function, name it custom_statistic.
Additional parameters can also be passed to the density function used
to estimate the RIF of quantiles.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>ob_decompose()</code> contains for four different decomposition methods of
observed group differences.
</p>
<p>1. The original Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition (default)
2. A 'doubly robust Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition (<code>reweighting=TRUE</code>)
3. A RIF Regression decomposition. (e.g., <code>rifreg_statistic="quantiles"</code>)
4. A reweighted RIF regression decomposition. (<code>reweighting=TRUE</code> and <code>rifreg_statistic="quantiles"</code>)
</p>
<p>The doubly robust OB decomposition is a robust and path independent alternative
for detailed decompositions at the mean. is to combine reweighting with the linear Oaxaca-Blinder method (see
Fortin et al., 2011: 48-51). This approach has the valuable side effect of
accounting for potential errors introduced by an incomplete inverse probability
weighting and the linear model specification, respectively.
</p>
<p>A path independent method that goes beyond the mean is the RIF decomposition
of Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2018). The approach approximates the expected value
of the 'recentered influence function' (RIF) of the distributional statistic
(e.g., quantile, variance, or Gini coefficient) of an outcome variable
conditional on covariates with linear regressions. RIF regression coefficients can
be consistent estimates of the marginal effect
of a small change in the expected value of a covariate to the distributional statistics of
an outcome variable (see documentation of the companion package <code>rifreg</code>).
Thus, they can be used to decompose between-group difference in distributional statistics.
Firpo et al. (2018) combine the RIF regressions again with the reweighting estimator to avoid specification errors.
</p>

decomposition results for the quantiles and for the other distributional
statistics, respectively, a data.frame with the estimated reweighting factor

factors and a list with standard errors for the decomposition terms, the
quantiles of the reweighting factor, the bootstrapped
Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution to construct uniform confidence bands for
quantiles, as well as a list with the normalized differences between the
covariate means of the comparison group and the reweighted reference group.
</p>
