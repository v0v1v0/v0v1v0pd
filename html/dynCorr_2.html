<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes dynamical correlation estimates for pairs of longitudinal
responses, including consideration of lags and derivatives,
following a local polynomial regression smoothing step.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dynamicCorrelation(dataFrame, depVar, indepVar, subjectVar,
                   function.choice, width.range, width.place,
                   min.obs, points.length, points.by, boundary.trunc,
                   lag.input, byOrder, by.deriv.only, full.lag.output)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataFrame</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data frame that contains the dependent
variables/responses, the independent variable (often time),
and the subject/individual identification; there should be
one row entry for each combination of subject/individual and
indepVar (often time).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>depVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Dependent variables/responses; at least two are
necessary for purposes of calculating at least one dynamical
correlation estimate of interest; there should be a unique
column within depVar for each response.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>indepVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Independent variable, typically the discrete
recorded time points at which the dependent variables were
collected; note that this is the independent variable for
purposes of curve creation leading into estimating the dynamical
correlations between pairs of dependent variables; must be
contained in a single column.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subjectVar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Column name of the individuals; there should be
one row entry for each combination of subject/individual and indepVar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>function.choice</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length 3 to indicate which
derivatives desired for local polynomial curve smoothing;
1st entry is for 0th derivative (i.e., original function),
2nd entry is for 1st derivative, 3rd is for 2nd derivative;
1=yes, 0=no. e.g., c(1,0,1) would be specified if interest
is in looking at derivative 0 and derivative 2, c(1,0,0)
for looking at original function (0th derivative) only, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>width.range</code></td>
<td>
<p>Bandwidth for local polynomial regression curve
smoothing for each dependent variable/response; it can be a list
that specifies a distinct bandwidth two-element vector for each
response, or a single two-element vector that is used for each of
the responses — the program is currently set up to allow linearly
increasing or decreasing bandwidths, specified by this two-element
vector with the increase (or decrease) occurring from the first argument
in width.place to its second argument; the lpepa function within the
lpridge package is called, which uses Epanecknikov kernel weighting,
and the specifications of bandwidth in width.range will be used there;
the default bandwidth is the range of indepVar (usually time) divided
by 4, i.e., a constant global bandwidth.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>width.place</code></td>
<td>
<p>Endpoints for width change assuming a non-constant
bandwidth requested — the program is currently set up to allow linearly
increasing or decreasing bandwidths, specified in width.range, with the
increase (or decrease) occurring from the first argument in width.place
to its second argument; it can be a list that specifies different
endpoints for each response, or a single vector of endpoints that is
used for each of the responses; default is no endpoints specified
which means constant global bandwidth throughout the range of indepVar.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>min.obs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum oberservation (follow-up period) required.
If specified, individuals whose follow-up period shorter than min.obs will
be removed from calculation. Default = NA (use whole dataset provided).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>points.length</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of indep (time) points for dynamic correlation 
calculation for each response of each individual. This is the number of 
points between time 0 and minimum of maximum of individual follow-up 
periods (max_common_obs). Note that each individual’s full follow-up 
time span is used in the local polynomial regression curve smoothing 
step, but only the first points.length number of time points (from time 0 
to max_common_obs) is used in the following dynamic correlation calculation. 
Default points.length value is set to 100; points.length takes precedence 
unless points.by is specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>points.by</code></td>
<td>
<p>Interval between indep (time) points for local polynomial
regression curve smoothing for each response of each individual.
Both integer and non-integer value could be specified, and time grid will
be computed accordingly. Note that points.length takes precedence
(default = 100) unless points.by is specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>boundary.trunc</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicate the boundary of indepVar that should be
truncated after smoothing; this may be done in case of concerns about
estimating dynamical correlation at the boundaries of indepVar; this
is a two element vector, where the first argument is how much to
truncate from the right of the minimum value of indep.var and the
second argument is how much to truncate from the left of the maximum
value of indep var, within an individual and specific response;
default is no truncation, i.e., c(0,0).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lag.input</code></td>
<td>
<p>Values of lag to be considered; can be a vector of
requested lags, for which a dynamical correlation estimate will be
produced for each pair of responses at each lag; a positive value
of lag.input means that the first entry for the dynamical correlation
leads (occurs before) the second entry — conversely, a negative value
means that the second entry for the correlation leads the first entry;
default is no lag at all considered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>byOrder</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector that specifies the order of the
variables/responses and derivatives (if any) to be the leading
variable in the calculations; this will have an effect on how
lag.input is to be interpreted; default is to use the order as
specified in the depVar argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>by.deriv.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the inter-dynamical correlations
between different derivatives are not computed, which can save
computation time (e.g., when function.choice=c(1,0,1) is specified
and by.deriv.only=T, then only dynamical correlations will be
calculated within (and not across) the 0th and 2nd derivative
estimates, respectively); default is TRUE.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>full.lag.output</code></td>
<td>
<p>If TRUE, the dynamical correlation values
for each pair of responses and requested derivative will be stored
in vectors corresponding to different lag values, which enables
plotting the correlations as a function of lag values; all the vectors
will be stored in the returned attribute resultMatrix; default is FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function will provide smooth estimates (curves/functions
or their derivatives) of longitudinal responses of interest per
individual, then generate dynamical correlation estimates for each pair
of responses. Lags of interest can be specified, using the lag.input
argument. For smoothing, the function uses local polynomial smoothing
using Epanecknikov kernel weighting (by calling the function lpepa within
the lpridge package). The default global bandwidth is generated by taking
the range of indepVar (usually time) and dividing by 4. This, by default,
will be a constant global bandwidth, but proper specification of the
width.range and width.place arguments can allow for a more flexible
bandwidth choice, including different specification for each response
in depVar. Note that the correlation will only be calculated as far as 
min of max observation time (max_common_obs) across all individuals, 
by default, hence caution should be taken if there is large heterogeneity 
among max observation times across individuals. <br><br>
Details of the methodology for dynamical correlation can be found in
Dubin and Muller (2005).
