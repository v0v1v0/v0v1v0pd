<h2>NIRmilk</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Near infra red light (NIR) measurements are made at
152 wavelengths on 17 milk samples.  While milk runs through a
glass tube, infra red light is sent through the tube and the
amount of light passing though the tube is measured at
different wavelengths.  Each milk sample was additionally
analysed for fat, lactose, protein and dry matter.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This data frame contains 17 rows and 158 columns.  The
first column is the sample number.  The columns <code>Xklm</code> contains
the transmittance (fraction of electromagnetic power)
transmittance through the sample at wavelength <code>klm</code>.  The
response variables are fat, protein, lactose and dm (dry
matter).
