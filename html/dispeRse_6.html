<h2>Simulates first arrival times from one or more origins.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The model uses density-dependent growth and emigration. The carrying
capacity, growth rates and mobility are allowed to vary with the environment.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simulate_dispersal(
  environment,
  terrain,
  coords,
  years,
  r = 0.025,
  phi = 0.5,
  t = 30,
  dist = 50,
  accel = 3,
  gamma = 1,
  updates = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>environment</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Raster*. Environmental values that affect carrying
capacity and growth rate. Typically given as a fraction (0-1) of the max K.
If the environment will be updated during the experiment, this parameter
must be a raster stack.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>terrain</code></td>
<td>
<p>A Raster*. Cells with value 1 are barriers and cells with
value 2 are corridors. If the terrain will be updated during the experiment,
this parameter must be a raster stack.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>coords</code></td>
<td>
<p>A DataFrame. Must contain columns x, y, and date with the
coordinates and starting date (yr BP) of each origin. Coordinates must be in
the same system as the environment and terrain layers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>years</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Number of years to run the model for.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>r</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The annual growth rate as a decimal.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phi</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The emigration threshold as a fraction of carrying
capacity.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The duration, in years, of a generation (model time step).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The distance, in km, that migrants move over a
generation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>accel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. The factor by which the usual distance is increased
along corridors. E.g. if dist = 50 km and accel = 3, migrants can move up to
150 km along a corridor. Must range from 2 to 4.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. A power that controls the shape of the dependency
between r and the environment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>updates</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric. Optional vector with the years at which the
environment and terrain grids will be updated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean. If TRUE, write messages to the console.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulation starts with n populated cells at coordinates and start times
defined by the parameter coords and runs for a number of time. Each time step
corresponds to a generation (defined by parameter t). Growth is applied to
every populated cell using a logistic model and emigration to a neighboring
cell is calculated from an asymptotic threshold model.
</p>
<p>The carrying capacity (K) in the density-dependend growth and emigration
models is determined by an environment raster, which normally represents a
variable or combination of variables assumed to affect population density
(e.g. net primary production, elevation) scaled to 0-1 range.
</p>
<p>The dependence of the carrying capacity and growth rate on the environment
is allowed to be controlled by a power gamma. By default, the dependence is
linear (gamma = 1).
</p>
<p>For emigration, a threshold phi is considered, expressed as a fraction of
carrying capacity. Migrants are distributed among the available cells of the
Moore neighborhood proportionally to the inverse of the distance squared.
</p>
<p>Terrain can be represented by a raster specifying barriers (e.g. mountains),
which block movement, and corridors (e.g. rivers), which accelerate movement.
For the latter, an acceleration factor can be specified.
</p>
