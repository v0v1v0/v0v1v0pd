It searches for an environment named <code>ENVS</code> within the current environment,
that holds the object with the given <code>name</code>. Such an environment is constructed and populated
with objects specified in the yaml <code>objects</code> property and passed along
to subsequent R and Rmd files as DataPackageR processes them in order.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
if(rmarkdown::pandoc_available()){
ENVS &lt;- new.env() # ENVS would be in the environment
                  # where the data processing is run. It is
                  # handled automatically by the package.
assign("find_me", 100, ENVS) #This is done automatically by DataPackageR

find_me &lt;- datapackager_object_read("find_me") # This would appear in an Rmd processed by
                                    # DataPackageR to access the object named "find_me" created
                                    # by a previous script. "find_me" would also need to
                                    # appear in the objects property of datapackager.yml
}
