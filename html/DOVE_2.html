<h2>Durability of Vaccine Efficacy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the potentially waning long-term efficacy of vaccines in
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with staggered
enrollment of participants and sequential crossover of placebo recipients.
The log hazard ratio for the vaccine effect is assumed to be a 
piecewise linear function of time since vaccination, whereas the
baseline hazard function is nonparametric.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dove2(
  formula,
  data,
  plots = TRUE,
  changePts = NULL,
  constantVE = FALSE,
  timePts = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula object, with the response on the left-hand side of a
'~' operator, and the covariates and vaccine() function on the right-hand side.  
The response must be a survival analysis object as returned by the 'Surv'
function of the <span class="pkg">survival</span> package. See Details for further information.
The vaccine() function must be used to specify the entry time and
vaccination information. See ?vaccine and Details for further
information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame object. The data.frame in which to interpret the
variable names in formula. Must contain the entry time, the event time,
the event status, the vaccination status,
the vaccination time, and the covariates. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plots</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical object. If TRUE (default), plots of the estimated 
VE in reducing the attack rate, the estimated VE in reducing the hazard rate, 
and their 95% confidence intervals will be automatically generated. 
If FALSE, plots will not be generated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>changePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numerical vector object or NULL. The potential change
points (in days) of the piece-wise log-linear hazard ratio for the
vaccine effect. See Details 
for further information. If NULL, one change point will automatically be 
selected among {28, 35, 42, 49, 56} (Weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, 8) by the 
Akaike information criterion (AIC).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constantVE</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical object. If FALSE (default), VE is allowed to 
vary after the last change point. If TRUE, VE is assumed to be 
constant after the last change point.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numerical vector object or NULL. The endpoints (in days) 
of the time periods for which the VE in reducing the attack rate are to
be estimated. If NULL, a default sequence 
<code class="reqn">t_1, 2t_1, 3t_1, \dots</code> will be used, where <code class="reqn">t_1</code> is the first 
change point. The sequence ends at the maximum of the event times from all 
participants. This input is ignored when constantVE = TRUE.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In dove2(), the log hazard ratio for the vaccine effect is a piecewise 
linear function of time since vaccination.
Its sister function, dove(), allows the hazard ratio to be a 
nonparametric function of time for which confidence intervals are not 
provided. The approach implemented in dove2() provides more precise and 
more stable estimates of vaccine efficacy on the hazard rate and includes 
proper confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>The information required for an analysis is 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Entry Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when the participant enters the 
trial.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Event Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when the participant experiences
the clinical event of interest (e.g., symptomatic COVID-19) or the
follow-up ends, whichever occurs first.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Event Status:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Binary indicator taking value 1 if the clinical
event of interest occurs before the end of follow-up and 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vaccination Status:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Binary indicator taking value 1 if
vaccination occurs before the end of follow-up and 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vaccination Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when vaccination takes place,
with NA, Inf, or an arbitrary non-negative value
if the participant is not vaccinated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Covariates:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Baseline covariates (e.g., priority group, age, 
ethnicity).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that all the time variables are measured from the start of the 
clinical trial and are specified in units of days. 
For each individual, the entry_time, event_time, and vaccination_time must satisfy
entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> event_time and entry_time <code class="reqn">\le</code> vaccination_time. 
If entry_time &gt; event_time or entry_time &gt; vaccination_time, the case will be 
removed from the analysis and a message will be generated.  
</p>
<p>The general structure of the formula input is
</p>
<pre>
  Surv(event_time, event_status) ~ covariates + 
    vaccine(entry_time, vaccination_status, vaccination_time)
  </pre>
<p>The response variable must be a survival analysis object as returned by the
'Surv()' function of package <span class="pkg">survival</span>, where event_time is the
observation time (formal argument 'time') and event_status is the status
indicator input (formal argument 'event'). Specifically, 
</p>
<pre>Surv(time = event_time, event = event_status)</pre>
<p>The covariates can be either numerical or categorical.
If categorical covariates are provided, all other categories are compared to the first category.
A model without covariates is also allowed.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class DOVE containing a list with elements
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>call</code></td>
<td>
<p>The unevaluated call.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>changePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>The changePts of the analysis.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covariates</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix containing the estimated (log) hazard ratio of
each covariate, together with the estimated standard error, the 95%
confidence interval, and the two-sided p-value for testing no covariate
effect. NA if no covariate is included in the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccine</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing one or three elements, depending on the 
value of constantVE. 
If constantVE = TRUE, the only element is named 'VE' and is a vector 
containing the estimate of constant VE, its standard error estimate, 
and the 95% confidence interval.
If constantVE = FALSE, three matrices are returned. The first matrix 
named 'VE_a' contains the daily VE estimates in reducing the attack 
rate, together with the 95% confidence intervals. The second matrix 
named 'VE_h' contains the daily VE estimates in reducing the hazard rate,
together with the 95% confidence intervals.
The third matrix named 'VE_period' contains the estimates of VE in
reducing the attack rate over successive time periods according to
timePts, together with the 95% confidence intervals.</p>
