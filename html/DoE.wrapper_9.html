<h2> Wrapper package for design of experiments functionality </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package creates various kinds of designs for (industrial) experiments. 
It uses, and sometimes enhances, design generation routines from other packages. 
So far, response surface designs from package rsm, designs for computer 
experiments (latin hypercube samples etc.) from packages lhs and DiceDesign 
and D-optimal designs from package AlgDesign have been implemented.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, the package provides classical response surface designs from package 
<span class="pkg">rsm</span>: Box-Behnken designs by Box and Behnken (function <code>bbd.design</code> 
and central composite designs by Box and Wilson (<code>ccd.design</code>) are implemented. 
For the latter, there is also a function for augmenting 2-level fractional factorials 
into central composite designs (<code>ccd.design</code>).
</p>
<p>Furthermore, latin hypercube samples and other designs for computer experiments 
from packages <span class="pkg">lhs</span> and <span class="pkg">DiceDesign</span> are provided. 
</p>
<p>Furthermore, D-optimal designs have been implemented, 
using package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>. This implementation is currently in beta shape.
</p>
<p>All designs created by this package are class <code>design</code> objects, 
which are data frames with attributes.
</p>
<p>Apart from providing designs, the package also provides functions for comparing 
the quality of several designs with quantitative variables (function <code>compare</code>).
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> This package is still under (slow) development. Reports about bugs and inconveniences are welcome.</p>
