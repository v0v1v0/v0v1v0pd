<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The wines were served in dark glasses and the sorting task
was performed with red light (this way 
all wines look black). In the experiment, 
the wines were labeled with three-digit codes, for more details 
see Ballester <em>et al.</em> (2009).
Only the experts performed the free sorting task.
</p>
<p>In the data sets, the wines are identified with shortened
names, the whole names can be found in the data frame.
All the wines were from the 2005 vintage 
(see Ballester <em>et al.</em>, 2009 for details)
</p>
<p>Compared to the original data, some missing data were added
to the set after imputation of the missing data 
(a total of 4 entries). The current data include 
only 19 experts out the original 27 experts.
