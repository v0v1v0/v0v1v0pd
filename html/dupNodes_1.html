<h2>Computes betweenness of an igraph object that already has duplicated nodes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an implementation of the method published in the paper "Intra-family links in the analysis of marital networks" (Merelo and Molinari 2024), which proposed a duplication of nodes that includes self-loops to get a reflect better (and include all information about) the status of all nodes in the network, computing betweenness ignoring the duplicated nodes.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">betweenness.with.duplicated.nodes(dup.graph)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dup.graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph object that has already duplicated nodes with self-loops. Essentially, it will recognize duplicated nodes as those with a prime at the end. Will not return betweenness value for these (it will be exactly the same as the other one).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality in the regular way for the graph that includes duplicated nodes; it will only return values for the "original" nodes, however.
</p>
<p>This object should be created with the function <code>dup.nodes.from.data.frame</code> or <code>dup.nodes.from.graph</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with betweenness values indexed by node name.</p>
