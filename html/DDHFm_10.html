<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The code is well commented for further information.
</p>
<p>First, <code>genesimulator</code> is called to obtain a vector of
mean gene intensities (for a number of genes and a number of replicates
for each gene.
</p>
<p>Then <code>link{simdurbin2}</code> simulates a series of gene intensities
using the (log-normal type) model as described in Durbin and Rocke  
(2001,2002).
</p>
<p>Then for each gene the mean of replicates for that gene is computed.
</p>
<p>Optionally, if <code>plot.it</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then the mean 
is plotted against its standard deviation (over
replicates).
</p>
<p>Then the intensities are sorted according to increasing replicate mean.
</p>
<p>Optionally, if <code>plot.it</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then a plot of the
intensities values as a vector (sorted according to increasing
replicate mean) is plotted in black, and then the true mean plotted
in colour 2 (on my screen this is red) and the computed replicate
mean plotted in green.
</p>
<p>The DDHF transform of the sorted intensities is computed.
</p>
<p>Optionally, if <code>plot.it</code> is <code>TRUE</code> then a plot of the
transformed means versus the transformed standard deviations is plotted.
Followed by a time series plot of the transformed sorted intensities.
These can be studied to see how well DDHF has done the transformation.
</p>
<p>Then two smoothing methods are applied the the DDHF transformed data.
One method is translation invariant, Haar wavelet universal thresholding.
The other method is the classical smoothing spline. If <code>plot.it</code> is
<code>TRUE</code> then these smoothed estimates are plotted in different
colours.
</p>
<p>Then the mean estimated intensity for each gene is  computed and this
is returned as the first column of a two-column matrix (<code>ansm</code>).
The second column is the true underlying mean. The object
<code>hftssq</code> contains a measure of error between the estimated
and true gene means.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#
# First run hftrialdatagen
#
## Not run: v &lt;- hftrialdatagen()
#
# Now plot the Haar-Fisz transformed intensities.
#
## Not run: ts.plot(v$yhf)
#
# Now plot the denoised intensities 
#
# Note that above we have 128 genes and 4 replicates and so there are
# 4*128 = 512 intensities to plot.
#
# However, there are only 128 gene intensities, and estimates. So, for this
# plot we choose to plot the noisy intensities and then for each replicate
# group (which are colocated on the plot) plot the (necessarily constant)
# true and estimated intensities (ie we plot each true/estimated intensity
# 4 times, once for each replicate).
#
# First estimates...
#
## Not run: lines(1:512, rep(v$ansm[,1], rep(4,128)), col=2)
#
# Now plot the truth
#
## Not run: lines(1:512, rep(v$ansm[,2], rep(4,128)), col=3)
