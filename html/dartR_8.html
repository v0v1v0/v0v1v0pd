<h2>Eliminates populations as possible source populations for an 
individual of unknown provenance, using private alleles</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This script eliminates from consideration as putative source populations,
those populations for which the individual has too many private alleles. The
populations that remain are putative source populations, subject to further
consideration.
</p>
<p>The algorithm identifies those target populations for which the individual
has no private alleles or for which the number of private alleles does not
exceed a user specified threshold.
</p>
<p>An excessive count of private alleles is an indication that the unknown does
not belong to a target population (provided that the sample size is
adequate, say &gt;=10).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gl.assign.pa(
  x,
  unknown,
  nmin = 10,
  threshold = 0,
  n.best = NULL,
  verbose = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the input genlight object [required].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unknown</code></td>
<td>
<p>SpecimenID label (indName) of the focal individual whose
provenance is unknown [required].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nmin</code></td>
<td>
<p>Minimum sample size for a target population to be included in the
analysis [default 10].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>Populations to retain for consideration; those for which the
focal individual has less than or equal to threshold loci with private
alleles [default 0].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.best</code></td>
<td>
<p>If given a value, dictates the best n=n.best populations to
retain for consideration (or more if their are ties) based on private alleles
[default NULL].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Verbosity: 0, silent or fatal errors; 1, begin and end; 2,
progress log; 3, progress and results summary; 5, full report
[default 2 or as specified using gl.set.verbosity].</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A genlight object containing the focal individual (assigned to
population 'unknown') and populations for which the focal individual is not
distinctive (number of loci with private alleles less than or equal to the
threshold). If no such populations, the genlight object contains only data
for the unknown individual.
