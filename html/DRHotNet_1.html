<h2>Identifies differential risk hotspots along a linear network given a vector of relative probabilities computed over the middle points of the segments of the network</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a relative probability surface corresponding to the occurrence of a type of event along a linear network, this function filters and groups in hotspots those segments satisfying two conditions: 1) the relative probability in the segment exceeds the average relative probability per segment in <code>k</code> times the standard deviation of the complete set of probabilities estimated across all the segments of the network, and 2) there are <code>n</code> or more events at a distance below <code>h</code> from the middle point of the segment (<code>h</code> is obtained from the object <code>rel_probs</code> computed with the function <code>relpnet</code>). In summary, <code>k</code> and <code>n</code> control the formation of differential risk hotspots along the network, given a set of relative probabilities covering the network. The choice of a higher value for <code>k</code> or <code>n</code> (or both) represents a more strict criterion and leads to a lower number of differential risk hotspots being detected. Users should test several values of <code>k</code> and <code>n</code> (sensitivity analysis on <code>k</code> and <code>n</code>) in order to reach reasonable choices for the research or practical purposes of their data analyses. This sensitivity analysis can be carried out with the <code>drsens</code> function

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drhot(X, rel_probs, k, n, dist = "path", event_distances = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>- A <code>lpp</code> object representing a marked point pattern lying on a road network (<code>linnet</code> object)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rel_probs</code></td>
<td>
<p>- An object containing the relative probabilities of a specific type of event along the linear network contained in <code>X</code>, generated through the function <code>relpnet</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>- A numeric value that controls the procedure of detecting differential risk hotspots (departure from average relative probability), as described above</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>- A numeric value that controls the procedure of detecting differential risk hotspots (minimum size for the sample of events implicated in the computation of the relative probabilities), as described above</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dist</code></td>
<td>
<p>- A character indicating which distance to use. Two values are allowed: <code>path</code> (shortest-path distance) and <code>euclidean</code> (Euclidean distance). By default, the shortest-path distance is used. Change to <code>euclidean</code> to reduce the computation time or skip memory issues</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>event_distances</code></td>
<td>
<p>- A matrix that contains the distances between the middle points of the segments satisfying the condition on parameter <code>k</code> and the events o <code>X</code>. By default it is set to <code>NULL</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list that contains the differential risk hotspots found for <code>X</code> and the type of event specified by <code>rel_probs</code>
