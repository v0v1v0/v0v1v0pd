<h2>Document a Single R Code File</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Have you ever been tempted to create <span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>-style documentation
comments
for one of your functions that was not part of one of your packages (yet)?
This is exactly what this package is about: running
<code>roxygen2::roxygenize</code> on (chunks of)
a single code file.<br>
This package enables you to
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> create function documentation with <span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> detect code/documentation mismatches
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> save the documentation to disk
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> view the documentation in your interactive R session
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You will probably be looking for <code>document</code> and
<code>man</code>, the remaining functions are mainly
for internal use.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R is a programming language that supports and checks documentation for
program libraries (called ‘packages’). The package <span class="pkg">roxygen2</span> provides a
tool for creating documentation from annotated source code - much like
<code>doxygen</code>, <code>javadoc</code> and <code>docstrings/pydoc</code> do.
</p>
<p>And R is a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics,
used by people like me who start out hacking down code, eventually pouring
chunks of code into functions (and sometimes even ending up creating and
documenting packages).
Along that work flow you cannot use R's documentation system, let alone
<span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>, unless you have come to forge your code into a package.
</p>
<p>I am fully aware of the fact that <span class="pkg">roxygen2</span> is meant to document
packages, not single code chunks.
So should you. Nevertheless I feel the temptation to use
<span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>-style comments in code chunks that are not part of any
package. And to convert them to pdf for better readability.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>This package writes to disk, so <strong>never</strong> run as superuser.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This package is basically a wrapper to
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>. It internally creates a temporary package from the
code file provided (using
<code>utils::package.skeleton</code>)
which it then passes to
<code>roxygen2::roxygenize</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>R CMD</code> commands run by <span class="pkg">callr</span>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>See Also</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">docstring</span>
(<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=docstring">https://cran.r-project.org/package=docstring</a>) also creates temporary
help pages as well but using a different technical approach (allowing you to
view them in the <code>RStudio</code> help pane). But it creates them from python
style <code>docstring</code>-like comments it then parses into <span class="pkg">roxygen2</span>.
And it does not write to file so far.
