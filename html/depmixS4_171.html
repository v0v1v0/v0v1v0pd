<h2>Speed Accuracy Switching Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is a bivariate series of response times and accuracy
scores of a single participant switching between slow/accurate
responding and fast guessing on a lexical decision task.  The slow and
accurate responding, and the fast guessing can be modelled using two
states, with a switching regime between them.  The dataset further
contains a third variable called Pacc, representing the relative
pay-off for accurate responding, which is on a scale of zero to one.
The value of Pacc was varied during the experiment to induce the
switching.  This data set is a from participant A in experiment 
1a from Dutilh et al (2011).
