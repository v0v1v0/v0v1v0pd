<h2> Samples of the posterior distributions obtained from a Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset provides a sample from the posterior distributions of the various parameters resulting from a Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis model, that are needed to create a summary plot in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.
</p>
<p>The posterior samples were obtained by fitting the Bivariate model using the rjags package to data from a systematic review of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) for rheumatoid arthritis.  Overall, 37 studies were meta-analyzed, a total of 3 chains were used with 14,000 burn-in iterations after which we drew 1,000 samples from the posterior distributions for the following parameters:
</p>
<p>“mu[1]” for the mean logit-transformed sensitivity. <br>
“mu[2]” for the mean logit-transformed specificity. <br>
“tau[1]” for the between-study standard deviation in the logit-transformed sensitivity. <br>
“tau[2]” for the between-study standard deviation in the logit-transformed specificity. <br>
“rho” for the correlation between the mean logit-transformed  sensitivity and the mean logit-transformed specificity. <br>
“se” for the logit-transformed sensitivity in individual studies. <br>
“sp” for the logit-transformed specificity in individual studies. <br>
“Mean_Se” for the mean sensitivity. <br>
“Mean_Sp” for the mean specificity. <br></p>
