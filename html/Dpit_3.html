<h2>Distribution Pitting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compares distributions with one another in terms of their fit to each sample in a dataset that contains multiple samples, as described in Joo, Aguinis, and Bradley (2017). Users can examine the fit of seven distributions per sample: pure power law, lognormal, exponential, power law with an exponential cutoff, normal, Poisson, and Weibull. Automation features allow the user to compare all distributions for all samples with a single command line, which creates a separate row containing results for each sample until the entire dataset has been analyzed. Automation features also skip over any unsuccessful calculations and continues analyzing the remainder of the samples. When calculations fail (e.g., sample size was too small), "NA" entries will be printed in the relevant cells of the results matrix before continuing with subsequent calculations.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Dpit(x)	
	  </code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data set</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For a given sample, the Dpit() function does not truncate (i.e., discard) data points that fall below a certain threshold, or xmin. More precisely, Dpit() sets xmin at the lowest positive number in the sample. This is because, theoretically, the function focuses on assessing the fit of distributions in their entirety rather than their tail ends. In other words, the goal of Dpit() is to conclude whether a sample itself follows a certain type of distribution, not whether the tail end of the sample follows a certain type of distribution.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function returns a data frame containing the complete detailed results of distribution pitting. In the data frame, each row corresponds to a sample, or data vector. That is, the first row in the data frame is sample #1, the second row is sample #2, etc. Each column in the data frame shows a distribution pitting statistic per sample. The data frame contains a large number of columns–as described in detail below:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>PLvCut.rawLR</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A loglikelihood ratio (LR) quantifying the degree to which a pure power law (PL) fits the focal sample better than a power law with an exponential cutoff (Cut). So, a positive value means that the power law with an exponential cutoff fits worse, whereas a negative value means that the pure power law fits worse. This loglikelihood ratio is not normalized–hence, the word "raw" in the label.</p>

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The Dpit() function is based on the R code found at:
<a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/">http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/</a>.  
In particular, we borrowed heavily from Cosma R. Shalizi's code. But our code differs from the aforementioned code in mainly three ways. First, the Dpit() function sets xmin at the lowest positive number in a sample to assess the fit of distributions in their entirety rather than their tail ends. Second, our code allows for the comparison of non-pure power law distributions with one another. Third, our code includes automation features that allow the user to compare all distributions for all samples with a single command line, which creates a separate row containing results for each sample until the entire dataset has been analyzed. Automation features clean each sample by removing missing cases and non-positive values that lead to incalculable expressions (e.g., the log of zero is undefined). Automation features also skip over any unsuccessful calculations and continues analyzing the remainder of the samples. When calculations fail (e.g., sample size was too small), "NA" entries will be printed in the relevant cells of the results matrix before continuing with subsequent calculations.
