<h2>Pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from a combination of several NOAA shipboard surveys conducted on
pan-tropical spotted dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico. The data consist of 47
observations of groups of dolphins. The group size was recorded, as well as
the Beaufort sea state at the time of the observation. Coordinates for each
observation and bathymetry data were also available as covariates for the
analysis. A complete example analysis (and description of the data) is
provided at <a href="http://distancesampling.org/R/vignettes/mexico-analysis.html">http://distancesampling.org/R/vignettes/mexico-analysis.html</a>.
