<h2>Computes interaction score for combined graphs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Writes the input data (combined graphs for both groups in 'gml' format and
lists of edges adjacent to drug targets for both groups in 'tsv' format) to files and calls a Python script
for calculating the interaction scores. Output files written by the Python script are two graphs in 'gml'
format containing the interaction score as an additional 'interaction_weight' edge attribute.
These are loaded and returned in a named list.
ATTENTION: Data exchange via files is mandatory and takes a long time for large data. Interaction
score computation is expensive and slow because it involves finding all simple paths up to a
certain length between source and target node of the drug target edges. Don't set the parameter 'max_path_length'
in <code>drdimont_settings</code> to a large value and only consider this step if your graphs have approximately
2 million edges or less. Computation is initiated by <code>calculate_interaction_score</code>.
The Python script is parallelized using Ray. Use the <code>drdimont_settings</code> parameter 'int_score_mode' to force sequential
or parallel computation. Refer to the Ray documentation if you encounter problems with running
the Python script in parallel. DISCLAIMER: Depending on the operating system Python comes
pre-installed or has to be installed manually. Use DrDimont's <code>install_python_dependencies</code> 
to install a virtual Python or conda environment containing the required Python packages. 
You can use the parameter 'conda' in <code>drdimont_settings</code> to specify if Python packages 
were installed with conda ('conda=TRUE'), else a virtual environment installed with pip is 
assumed (default: 'conda=FALSE').

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generate_interaction_score_graphs(graphs, drug_target_edgelists, settings)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graphs</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A named list with elements 'groupA' and 'groupB' containing the combined graphs
of each group as iGraph object ('graphs' from output of <code>generate_combined_graphs</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drug_target_edgelists</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A named list (elements 'groupA' and 'groupB'). Each element
contains the list of edges adjacent to drug targets as a data frame (columns 'from', 'to' and
'weight'). 'edgelists' from output of <code>determine_drug_targets</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>settings</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A named list containing pipeline settings. The settings list has to be
initialized by <code>drdimont_settings</code>. Items in the named list can be
adjusted as desired.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list (elements 'groupA' and 'groupB'). Each element contains an iGraph object
containing the interaction scores as interaction_weight attributes.
