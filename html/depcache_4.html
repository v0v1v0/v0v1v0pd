<h2>Evaluate an expression and cache its results</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function extracts all dependencies of an R expression, hashes
them together with the expression itself and either loads the
already-existing file, or evaluates the expression and stores the
result in that file.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  cache(expr, extra = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>expr</code></td>
<td>

<p>An expression to evaluate or load from cache, unquoted.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extra</code></td>
<td>

<p>Any R value that should be considered part of the state deciding
whether the expression should be re-computed. For example, if
<code>expr</code> reads a file, consider using <code>file.mtime</code> or
<code>md5sum</code> to check for changes in it.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Currently, the hash is obtained by means of serialisation. In order to
make semantically same values have same hashes on a wide range of R
versions, the following steps were taken: </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> When computing the hash of the serialized data (only the XDR
format version 2 or 3 is supported), the first 14 bytes containing
the header (including the version of R that serialized the data) are
ignored.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Every function is “rebuilt” from its body before
hashing, forcing R to discard the bytecode and the source references
from the copy of the function before it's hashed.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Strings are converted to UTF-8 before hashing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> All this is done recursively.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The exact algorithm used and the way hash is obtained are
implementation details and may eventually change, though not without a
good reason.
</p>
<p>Other aspects of R data structures are currently not handled:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Nothing is done about environments. Due to them being
reference objects, any fix-up must re-create them from scratch,
taking potentially recursive dependencies into account, which is
likely expensive.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Some S4 classes (like reference class implementations) just
have different representations in different versions of <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> and
third-party packages. They may mean the same thing, but they
serialize to different byte sequences.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The result of evaluating <code>expr</code>, either directly, or loaded from
cache.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  
  a &lt;- 1
  # will evaluate the expression the first time
  cache({ message('evaluating expression'); a + 1 }) # 2
  # saved value of the expression will be used
  cache({
    message('evaluating expression')
    # even if written a bit differently
    a + 1
  }) # 2
  a &lt;- -1
  # expression evaluated again because dependencies changed
  cache({ message('evaluating expression'); a + 1 }) # 0
  
</code></pre>
