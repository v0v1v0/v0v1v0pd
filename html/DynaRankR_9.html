<h2>Infer longitudinal hierarchy using informed matrix reordering</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implements the Informed MatReorder method described in Strauss &amp; Holekamp (in revision)
to infer a dominance hierarchy over multiple study periods. For each
study period, ranks are inferred as modifications of the ranks from the previous
study period. First, new contestants are added according to the convention specified
by the user, and emigrated/dead contestants are removed. Then, matrix reordering is used
to change the position of contestants for whom data from the current study period
are inconsistent with this ordering. The optimal order is selected as the order 
that is most consistent with the data from the current period and is minimally 
changed from the previous study period.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">informed_matreorder(
  contestants,
  convention,
  n = 50,
  shuffles = 10,
  require.corroboration = FALSE,
  initial.ranks = NULL,
  interactions
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>contestants</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe with the identities of the contestants for 
each study period along with the relevant data for 
adding them to the hierarchy. There should be one row per
contestant per study period.
Periods should appear in chronological order.
The dataframe should contain the following columns: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>
<p>Study period.</p>
</dd>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identity of contestant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>convention1</dt>
<dd>
<p>The primary convention by which new
individuals are added to the hierarchy. Interpretation
of this column varies depending on the value of the 
<strong>convention</strong> argument.</p>
</dd>
<dt>convention2</dt>
<dd>
<p>Optional. The secondary data for 
resolving ties in convention1. Interpretation
of this column varies depending on the value of the 
<strong>convention</strong> argument.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>convention</code></td>
<td>
<p>A flag determining how new individuals are added to the
hierarchy. The value of this flag influences how the convention1
and convention2 columns of the contestants argument are interpreted.
Currently this function supports four options:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>mri</dt>
<dd>
<p>New contestants are added to the hierarchy
according to maternal rank inheritance with youngest
ascendancy. <strong>convention1</strong> should be a vector of 
mother identities for each contestant. <strong>convention2</strong>
should be an optional vector of intra-litter ranks (lower 
numbers = higher rank) for resolving the order of 
contestants from the same mother
joining the hierarchy in the same study period.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tenure</dt>
<dd>
<p>New contestants are added to the hierarchy
according their tenure in the group. <strong>convention1</strong> should be a vector of 
dates on which each contestant joined the group. <strong>convention2</strong> should be an
optional vector of numerical data for resolving ties
in convention1 (e.g., body size). Higher values are 
considered higher rank.</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>New contestants are added to the hierarchy
according their age (older = higher rank).
<strong>convention1</strong> should be a vector of birthdates or 
numerical age classes. <strong>convention2</strong> should be an
optional vector of numerical data for resolving ties
in convention1 (e.g., body size). Higher values are 
considered higher rank.</p>
</dd>
<dt>phys_attr</dt>
<dd>
<p>New contestants are added to the hierarchy
according to some physical attribute (larger value = higher rank). 
<strong>convention1</strong> should be a vector of numerical attribute
measurements. <strong>convention2</strong> should be an
optional vector of numerical data for resolving ties
in convention1. Higher values are 
considered higher rank.</p>
</dd>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of separate reordering attempts per study period. Recommended 100.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shuffles</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of reshuffling steps per reordering attempt. Recommended at least 10.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>require.corroboration</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical indicating whether to require corroborating
evidence from multiple study periods before changing a contestant's position
in the order. Useful for reducing the sensitivity of the method to aberrant
observations that don't reflect a lasting change in the true latent hierarchy.
If true, evidence indicating a change in status must be corroborated by
an additional observation in the following periods. See Strauss &amp; Holekamp
(in revision) for full details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial.ranks</code></td>
<td>
<p>The initial ordering of individuals for the first study
period. Required if using maternal rank inheritance as the convention.
For other conventions, if initial.ranks is not specified,
the order determined by convention1 is used to create the initial order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interactions</code></td>
<td>
<p>A dataframe of interaction data with the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>winner</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identities of winners.</p>
</dd>
<dt>loser</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identities of losers.</p>
</dd>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>
<p>Study period in which interactions occurred.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Produces a dataframe with the following columns: 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>period</dt>
<dd>
<p>Study period.</p>
</dd>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identity of contestant.</p>
</dd>
<dt>rank</dt>
<dd>
<p>Ordinal rank of contestant in study period. Lower numbers
equal higher rank.</p>
</dd>
<dt>stan.rank</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rank of contestant standardized for group size.
Values range from 1 (highest rank) to -1 (lowest rank).</p>
</dd>
<dt>old.order</dt>
<dd>
<p>Identity of contestants arranged in the previous order (the order they
were in before updating the order based on observations from current
study period).</p>
</dd>
