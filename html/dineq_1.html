<h2>Decomposition of the change in inequality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Decomposition of the change in (income) inequality into multiple characteristics,
divided by a price and a quantity effect.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dineq_change_rb(formula1, weights1 = NULL, data1, formula2, weights2 = NULL,
  data2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

least squares regression.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function uses a multivariate regression-based decomposition method. Multiple
characteristics can be added to the function in order to calculate the contribution of each
individual variable (including the residual) to the change of the inequality. For instance
socio-economic,  demographic and geographic characteristics (such as age, household composition,
gender, region, education) of the household or the individual can be added.
</p>
<p>The change decomposition is divided into a price and a quantity effect for each characteristic.
The quantity effect is caused by changes in the relative size of subgroups (for instance: a higher
percentage of elderly households). The price effect is caused by a change in the influence of the
characteristic on the dependent variable (for instance a higher income for the elderly
households).
</p>
<p>It uses a logarithmic transformation of the values of the dependent variable. Therefore it
cannot handle negative or zero values. Those are excluded from the computation in this function.
</p>
<p>The decomposition can only be used on the variance of log income.
</p>
<p>The main difference with the decomposition of the change of the mean log deviation is that
multiple characteristics can be analyzed at the same time. While the decomposition function
only analyze one characteristic at the same time.
</p>
<p>The function uses two datasets for both years to compare. Pay attention that characteristics
should be the same (although can be named differently) and in the same order in the formula.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with the results of the decomposition and the parts used for the
decomposition, containing the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>attention</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional note on the difference in the input.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>variance_logincome</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values of the variance of log income of both years/datasets and
difference between both.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>decomposition_inequality</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (relative) decomposition of the inequality of both
years/datasets into the different variables. See function 'rb_decomp'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>decomposition_change_absolute</code></td>
<td>
<p>decomposition of the change in the variance
of log income into the different variables and residual split into price and quantity
effects. Adds up to the absolute change in variance of log income.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>decomposition_change_relative</code></td>
<td>
<p>decomposition of the change in the variance of log
income into the different variables and residual split into price and quantity effects.
Adds up to 100 percent.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>notes</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of zero or negative observations in both data sets/years. The function
uses a logarithmic transformation of x as input for the regression. Therefore these
observations are deleted from the analysis</p>
</td>
</tr>
