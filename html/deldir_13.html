<h2>
List Delaunay neighbours.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Lists the indices (or identifiers if these are provided) of the
Delaunay neighbours of each point in the set of points being
triangulated/tessellated.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">getNbrs(object, interior = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>

<p>An object of class <code>"deldir"</code>, as returned by the function
<code>deldir()</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>interior</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either a rectangle, i.e. a numeric vector of length 4,
<code>(xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax)</code>, or a polygon (a list with components
named <code>"x"</code> and <code>"y"</code>, which are numeric vectors
of equal length, say <code>n</code>.  The pairs <code>(x[i],y[i])</code>
specify the vertices of the polygon and should be presented in
<em>anticlockwise</em> order.  The last vertex should <b>NOT</b>
repeat the first.
</p>
<p>If <code>interior</code> is given as a rectangle, its entries must
satisfy <code>xmin &lt; xmax</code> and <code>ymin &lt; ymax</code>.  Moreover,
in this case, <code>interior</code> must be a subset of the rectangular
window <code>rw</code> (see <code>deldir()</code>) with respect to
which the points in question are being triangulated/tessellated.
That is, its entries must satisfy <code>rw[1] &lt;= xmin</code>, <code>xmax &lt;= rw[2]</code>,
<code>rw[3] &lt;= ymin</code> and <code>ymax &lt;= rw[4]</code>.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>interior</code> is specified then Delaunay neighbours are listed
only for those points which lie in <code>interior</code>.  Note that
these <em>neighbours</em> need not themselves lie in <code>interior</code>.
</p>
<p>Note also that it is possible for points <code>i</code> and <code>j</code> to
be neighbours even though the “clipped” versions of the tiles
are discontiguous.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A (named) list of length equal to the number points in the set
being triangulated/tessellated, or to the number of such points that
lie in <code>interior</code> if that argument was specified.  The names
of the list are the identifiers of the points as specified by
<code>id</code> if <code>id</code> was specified in the call to <code>deldir()</code>
that produced <code>object</code>.  If <code>id</code> was not specified, then
the names are the indices of the points, coerced to character mode.
</p>
<p>The entries of this list are vectors of the identifiers or
indices of the Delaunay neighbours of the point corresponding to
that entry.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Be careful about addressing the entries of the list returned
by this function.  If <code>id</code> was not specified in the call
to <code>deldir()</code> that produced <code>object</code>, then the names
of this list are the point indices coerced to character mode.
If <code>interior</code> was specified then the name of <code class="reqn">i</code>-th entry
of the list will not in general be <code>i</code>.  E.g. given that
<code>xxx</code> is the list returned by this function, <code>xxx[[14]]</code>
will <b>not</b> in general give the Delaunay neighbours of point 14.
Instead, specify <code>xxx[["14"]]</code> or <code>xxx[[id[14]]]</code> where
<code>id</code> is the vector of identifiers supplied in the call to
<code>deldir()</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set.seed(42)
x &lt;- runif(60)

nbrs[[14]]   # Incorrect.

# Thus nbrs[[14]] actually gives the Delaunay neighbours of point 42.
