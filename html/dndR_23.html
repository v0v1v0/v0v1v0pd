<h2>Balance a Combat Encounter for Given Party Composition and Difficulty</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identifies set of creature XP values that constitute a balanced encounter of specified difficulty for given party composition information (i.e., average player character level and number of party members). Creature selection is semi-random so re-running this function will return similar but not necessarily identical results. It is not always possible to exactly spend all available XP so the true maximum XP and the realized XP (see '?dndR::xp_pool' and '?dndR::xp_cost') are both returned in the output for context. This function _will not_ exceed the allowed XP so you may need to alter the party information and/or difficulty arguments in order to return an encounter that meets your needs.
</p>
