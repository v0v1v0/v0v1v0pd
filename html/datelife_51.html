<h2>Makes a block of node constraints and node calibrations for a MrBayes run file
from a list of taxa and ages, or from a dated tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Makes a block of node constraints and node calibrations for a MrBayes run file
from a list of taxa and ages, or from a dated tree
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_mrbayes_node_constraints(
  constraint = NULL,
  taxa = NULL,
  missing_taxa = NULL,
  ncalibration = NULL,
  age_distribution = "fixed",
  root_calibration = FALSE,
  mrbayes_constraints_file = NULL,
  clockratepr = "prset clockratepr = fixed(1);"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constraint</code></td>
<td>
<p>The constraint tree: a phylo object or a newick character string, with or without branch lengths.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>taxa</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector with taxon names to be maintained in tree</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_taxa</code></td>
<td>
<p>A tree, a data frame or a vector enlisting all missing taxa you want to include.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>A tree</dt>
<dd>
<p>Either as a phylo object or as a newick character string.
It contains all taxa that you want at the end, both missing and non missing.
This tree will be used as a hard constraint.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A <code>data.frame</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>It contains two columns named "taxon" and "clade".
The first one contains a character vector of missing taxon names.
The second one contains a character or numeric vector of nodes from a
constraint tree to which each taxon will be assigned.</p>
</dd>
<dt>A character vector</dt>
<dd>
<p>It contains the names of the missing taxa.
They will be added at random to the constraint tree.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ncalibration</code></td>
<td>
<p>The node calibrations: a phylo object with branch lengths
proportional to time; in this case all nodes from ncalibration will be used
as calibration points. Alternatively, a list with two elements: the first is
a character vector with node names from phy to calibrate; the second is a numeric
vector with the corresponding ages to use as calibrations.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>age_distribution</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying the type of calibration.
Only "fixed" and "uniform" are implemented for now.
</p>

<dl>
<dt>fixed</dt>
<dd>
<p>The age given in ncalibration will be used as fixed age.</p>
</dd>
<dt>lognormal</dt>
<dd>
<p>The age given in ncalibration will be used as mean age.
The standard deviation can be provided. # still need to add this option.
By default, a 95 CI sd is used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>uniform</dt>
<dd>
<p>The age given in ncalibration will be used as mean age.
Where min_age = 0.9 * mean age, and max_age = 1.1 * mean age.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>root_calibration</code></td>
<td>
<p>Used to set a calibration at the root or not. Default
to FALSE. Only relevant if ncalibration is specified.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mrbayes_constraints_file</code></td>
<td>
<p>NULL or a character vector indicating the name
of mrbayes constraint and/or calibration block file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clockratepr</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector indicating the clockrateprior to be used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A set of MrBayes constraints and/or calibration commands printed in console
as character strings or as a text file specified in mrbayes_constraints_file.
