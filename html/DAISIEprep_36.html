<h2>Extracts the stem age from the phylogeny when the a species is known to
belong to a genus but is not itself in the phylogeny and there are members
of the same genus are in the phylogeny. The stem age can either be for the
genus (or several genera) in the tree (<code>stem = "genus"</code>) or use an extraction
algorithm to find the stem of when the species colonised the island
(<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠stem = "island_presence⁠</code>), either 'min' or 'asr' as in
extract_island_species(). When <code>stem = "island_presence"</code>
the reconstructed node states are used
to determine the stem age.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extracts the stem age from the phylogeny when the a species is known to
belong to a genus but is not itself in the phylogeny and there are members
of the same genus are in the phylogeny. The stem age can either be for the
genus (or several genera) in the tree (<code>stem = "genus"</code>) or use an extraction
algorithm to find the stem of when the species colonised the island
(<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠stem = "island_presence⁠</code>), either 'min' or 'asr' as in
extract_island_species(). When <code>stem = "island_presence"</code>
the reconstructed node states are used
to determine the stem age.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">extract_stem_age(genus_name, phylod, stem, extraction_method = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genus_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string of genus name to be matched with a genus
name from the tip labels in the phylogeny</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phylod</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>phylo4d</code> object from the package <code>phylobase</code> containing
phylogenetic and endemicity data for each species.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stem</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character string, either "genus" or "island_presence". The former
will extract the stem age of the genussbased on the genus name provided, the
latter will extract the stem age based on the ancestral presence on the
island either based on the "min" or "asr" extraction algorithms.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extraction_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character string specifying whether the
colonisation time extracted is the minimum time (<code>min</code>) (before the present),
or the most probable time under ancestral state reconstruction (<code>asr</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric
