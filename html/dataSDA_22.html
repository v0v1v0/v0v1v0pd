<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An educational innovation project was carried out for improving
teaching-learning processes at the University of Oviedo (Spain)
for the 2020/2021 academic year. A total of 50 students have been
requested to answer an online questionnaire about some biographical
data (sex and age) and their perception of lack of information by selecting the
interval that best represents their level of agreement to the
statements proposed in a interval-valued scale bounded between 1 and 7,
where 1 represents the option 'strongly disagree' and 7 represents the option
'strongly agree'.
</p>
<p>These are the 5 items used to measure the perception of lack of information:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> I1: I receive too little information from my classmates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I2: It is difficult to receive relevant information from my classmates.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I3: It is difficult to receive relevant information from the teacher.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I4: The amount of information I receive from my classmates is very low.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> I5: The amount of information I receive from the teacher is very low.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
