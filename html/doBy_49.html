<h2>Fish oil in pig food</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Fish oil in pig food
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fatacid
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A fish oil fatty acid <code>X14</code> has been added in
different concentrations to the food for pigs in a
study. Interest is in studying how much of the fatty acid can
be found in the tissue. The concentrations of <code>x14</code> in the
food are <code>verb+dose+={0.0, 4.4, 6.2, 9.3}</code>.
</p>
<p>The pigs are fed with this food until their weight is 60 kg.  From
thereof and until they are slaughtered at 100kg, their food does
not contain the fish oil.
At 60kg (sample=1) and 100kg (sample=2) muscle
biopsies are made and the concentration of x14 is
determined.
Measurements on the same pig are correlated, and pigs are additionally
related through litters.
