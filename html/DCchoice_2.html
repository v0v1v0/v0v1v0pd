<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The original data are based on a telephone survey regarding quality improvements 
in the Albemarle-Pamlico sounds, North Carolina. The data were intensively analyzed, 
for instance, in Whitehead (1995) and Whitehead, et. al. (1998) in different contexts. Details of the survey can be 
found in the web site (see <em>Source</em> for the URL). 
</p>
<p>The original data have $1077$ observations and include the bids and the responses 
of the double-bounded dichotomous choice survey. Various socio-demographic 
characteristics are also collected by the survey. 
</p>
<p>A subset of the data consisting of the responses to the CVM questions
