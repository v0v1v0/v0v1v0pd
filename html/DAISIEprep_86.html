<h2>Select endemicity status from ancestral states probabilities</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Selects a state for each node (both internal nodes, i.e. ancestral states,
and tips, if included) from a table of probabilities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">select_endemicity_status(asr_df, method = "max")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>asr_df</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing at least these three columns:
not_present_prob | endemic_prob | nonendemic_prob (in any order). Each column
should contain the estimated probability of the state for each node (rows)
and these columns should sum to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>"max" or "random". "max" will select the state with highest
probability (selecting last state in event of a tie), while "random" will
sample the states randomly with the probabilities as weight for each state.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a character vector, with the selected endemicity status for each
node.
