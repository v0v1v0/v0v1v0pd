<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>data.frame</code> (of class <code>dht_result</code> for pretty printing) with
estimates and attributes containing additional information, see "Outputs"
for information on column names.
</p>


<h3>Data</h3>

<p>The data format allows for complex stratification schemes to be set-up. Three
objects are always required:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ddf</code> the detection function (see <code>ds</code> or
<code>ddf</code> for information on the format of their inputs).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>observations</code> has one row per observation and links the observations to
the transects. Required columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>object</code> (unique ID for the observation, which must match with the
data in the detection function)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Sample.Label</code> (unique ID for the transect).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Additional columns for strata which are not included in the detection
function are required (stratification covariates that are included in
the detection function do not need to be included here). The important
case here is group size, which must have column name <code>size</code> (but does
not need to be in the detection function).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <p><code>transects</code> has one row per sample (point or line transect). At least
one row is required. Required columns: <code>Sample.Label</code> (unique ID for the
transect), <code>Effort</code> (line length for line transects, number of visits for
point transects), if there is more than one geographical stratum.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With only these three arguments, abundance can only be calculated for the
covered area. Including additional information on the area we wish to
extrapolate to (i.e., the study area), we can obtain abundance estimates:
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code>geo_strat</code> has one row for each stratum that we wish to estimate
abundance for. For abundance in the study area, at least one row is
required. Required columns: <code>Area</code> (the area of that stratum). If there
is &gt;1 row, then additional columns, named in <code>strat_formula</code>.'
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Note that if the <code>Area</code> column is set to all 0, then only density estimates
will be returned.
</p>


<h3>Multipliers</h3>

<p>It is often the case that we cannot measure distances to individuals or
groups directly, but instead need to estimate distances to something they
produce (e.g., for whales, their blows; for elephants their dung) â€“ this is
referred to as indirect sampling. We may need to use estimates of production
rate and decay rate for these estimates (in the case of dung or nests) or
just production rates (in the case of songbird calls or whale blows). We
refer to these conversions between "number of cues" and "number of animals"
as "multipliers".
</p>
<p>The <code>multipliers</code> argument is a <code>list</code>, with 2 possible elements (<code>creation</code>
and <code>decay</code>). Each element of which is a <code>data.frame</code> and must have at least
a column named <code>rate</code>, which abundance estimates will be divided by (the
term "multiplier" is a misnomer, but kept for compatibility with Distance
for Windows). Additional columns can be added to give the standard error and
degrees of freedom for the rate if known as <code>SE</code> and <code>df</code>, respectively. You
can use a multirow <code>data.frame</code> to have different rates for different
geographical areas (for example). In this case the rows need to have a
column (or columns) to <code>merge</code> with the data (for example <code>Region.Label</code>).
</p>


<h3>Stratification</h3>

<p>The <code>strat_formula</code> argument is used to specify a column to use to stratify
the results, using the form <code>~column.name</code> where <code>column.name</code> is the column
name you wish to use.
</p>
<p>The <code>stratification</code> argument is used to specify which of four types of
stratification are intended:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"geographical"</code> if each stratum represents a different geographical
areas and you want the total over all the areas
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"effort_sum"</code> if your strata are in fact from replicate
surveys (perhaps using different designs) but you don't have many
replicates and/or want an estimate of "average variance"
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"replicate"</code> if you have replicate surveys but have many of them, this
calculates the average abundance and the variance between those many
surveys (think of a population of surveys)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"object"</code> if the stratification is really about the type of object
observed, for example sex, species or life stage and what you want is the
total number of individuals across all the classes of objects. For example,
if you have stratified by sex and have males and females, but also want a
total number of animals, you should use this option.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A simple example of using <code>stratification="geographical"</code> is given below.
Further examples can be found at <a href="http://examples.distancesampling.org/">http://examples.distancesampling.org/</a>
(see, e.g., the deer pellet survey).
</p>


<h3>Variance</h3>

<p>Variance in the estimated abundance comes from multiple sources. Depending
on the data used to fit the model and estimate abundance, different
components will be included in the estimated variances. In the simplest
case, the detection function and encounter rate variance need to be
combined. If group size varies, then this too must be included. Finally, if
multipliers are used and have corresponding standard errors given, this are
also included. Variances are combined by assuming independence between the
measures and adding variances. A brief summary of how each component is
calculated is given here, though see references for more details.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>detection function</em>: variance from the detection function parameters is
transformed to variance about the abundance via a sandwich estimator (see
e.g., Appendix C of Borchers et al (2002)).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>encounter rate</em>: for strata with &gt;1 transect in them, the encounter
rate estimators given in Fewster et al (2009) can be specified via the
<code>er_est</code> argument. If the argument <code>innes=TRUE</code> then calculations use the
estimated number of individuals in the transect (rather than the
observed), which was give by Innes et al (2002) as a superior estimator.
When there is only one transect in a stratum, Poisson variance is assumed.
Information on the Fewster encounter rate variance estimators are given in
<code>varn</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>group size</em>: if objects occur in groups (sometimes "clusters"), then
the empirical variance of the group sizes is added to the total variance.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>multipliers</em>: if multipliers with standard errors are given, their
corresponding variances are added. If no standard errors are supplied,
then their contribution to variance is assumed to be 0.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Units</h3>

<p>It is often the case that distances are recorded in one convenient set of
units, whereas the study area and effort are recorded in some other units.
To ensure that the results from this function are in the expected units, we
use the <code>convert_units</code> argument to supply a single number to convert the
units of the covered area to those of the study/stratification area (results
are always returned in the units of the study area). For line transects, the
covered area is calculated as <code>2 * width * length</code> where <code>width</code> is the
effective (half)width of the transect (often referred to as w in the
literature) and <code>length</code> is the line length (referred to as L). If <code>width</code>
and <code>length</code> are measured in kilometres and the study area in square
kilometres, then all is fine and <code>convert_units</code> is 1 (and can be ignored).
If, for example, line length and distances were measured in metres, we
instead need to convert this to be kilometres, by dividing by 1000 for each
of distance and length, hence <code>convert_units=1e-6</code>. For point transects,
this is slightly easier as we only have the radius and study area to
consider, so the conversion is just such that the units of the truncation
radius are the square root of the study area units.
