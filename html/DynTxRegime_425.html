<h2>Extract Model Coefficients From Objects Returned by Modeling Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A list is returned, one element for each regression step required by
the statistical method.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">coef(object, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>Value object returned by any statistical method implemented
in DynTxRegime.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional additional inputs defined by coefficient methods of 
selected regression functions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Methods are defined for all statistical methods implemented in DynTxRegime.
</p>
<p>The exact structure of the returned list will vary depending on
the statistical method. 
For methods that include a propensity regression, the returned list will 
include an element named 'propen'. For methods that include an outcome 
regression, the returned list will include an element named 'outcome'.
