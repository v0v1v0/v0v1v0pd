<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Having two samples <code class="reqn"> {X} ^ {n} </code> and <code class="reqn"> {Y} ^ {m} </code> using any depth function, we can compute depth values in a combined sample <code class="reqn"> {Z} ^ {n + m} = {X} ^ {n} \cup {Y} ^ {m} </code>, assuming the empirical distribution calculated basing on all observations, or only on observations belonging to one of the samples <code class="reqn"> {X} ^ {n} </code> or <code class="reqn"> {Y} ^ {m} </code>.
</p>
<p>For example if we observe <code class="reqn"> {X}_{l}'s </code> depths are more likely to cluster tightly around the center of the combined sample, while <code class="reqn"> {Y}_{l}'s </code> depths are more likely to scatter outlying positions, then we conclude <code class="reqn"> {Y} ^ {m} </code> was drawn from a distribution with larger scale.
</p>
<p>Properties of the DD plot based statistics in the i.i.d setting were studied by Li &amp; Liu (2004). Authors proposed several DD-plot based statistics and presented bootstrap arguments for their consistency and good effectiveness in comparison to Hotelling <code class="reqn"> T ^ 2 </code> and multivariate analogues of Ansari-Bradley and Tukey-Siegel statistics. Asymptotic distributions of depth based multivariate Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistic under the null and general alternative hypotheses were obtained by Zuo &amp; He (2006). Several properties of the depth based rang test involving its unbiasedness was critically discussed by Jureckova &amp; Kalina (2012). Basing on DD-plot object, which is available within the <span class="pkg">DepthProc</span> it is possible to define several multivariate generalizations of one-dimensional rank and order statistics in an easy way. These generalizations cover well known Wilcoxon rang-sum statistic.
</p>
<p>The depth based multivariate Wilcoxon rang sum test is especially useful for the multivariate scale changes detection and was introduced among other by Liu &amp; Singh (2003) and intensively studied by Jureckowa &amp; Kalina (2012) and Zuo &amp; He (2006) in the i.i.d. setting.
</p>
<p>For the samples <code class="reqn"> {{{X}} ^ {m}} = \{{{{X}}_{1}}, ..., {{{X}}_{m}}\} </code>, <code class="reqn"> {{{Y}} ^ {n}} = \{{{{Y}}_{1}}, ..., {{{Y}}_{n}}\} </code>, their <code class="reqn"> d_{1} ^ {X}, ..., d_{m} ^ {X} </code>, <code class="reqn"> d_{1} ^ {Y}, ..., d_{n} ^ {Y} </code>, depths w.r.t. a combined sample <code class="reqn"> {{Z}} = {{{X}} ^ {n}} \cup {{{Y}} ^ {m}} </code> the Wilcoxon statistic is defined as <code class="reqn"> S = \sum\limits_{i = 1} ^ {m}{{{R}_{i}}} </code>, where <code class="reqn"> {R}_{i} </code> denotes the rang of the i-th observation, <code class="reqn"> i = 1, ..., m </code> in the combined sample <code class="reqn"> R({{{y}}_{l}}) = \sharp\left\{ {{{z}}_{j}} \in {{{Z}}}:D({{{z}}_{j}}, {{Z}}) \le D({{{y}}_{l}}, {{Z}}) \right\}, l = 1, ..., m </code>.
</p>
<p>The distribution of <code class="reqn"> S </code> is symmetric about <code class="reqn"> E(S) = \frac{ 1 }{ 2 }m(m + n + 1) </code>, its variance is <code class="reqn"> {{D} ^ {2}}(S) = \frac{ 1 }{ 12 }mn(m + n + 1) </code>.
