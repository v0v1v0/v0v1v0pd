<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The devRate package provides three categories of functions:
</p>
<p>- to find development rate information about a specific organism (Order, Family, Genus, species): which equations were used and what are the associated parameters (e.g., helpful to estimate starting values for your empirical data sets);
</p>
<p>- to relate development rate and temperature; and
</p>
<p>- to plot your empirical datasets and the associated fitted model, and/or to plot development curves from the literature.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>You can use the package:
</p>
<p>- to get development rate curves as a function of temperature for a specific organism (hundred of examples from the literature are included in the package);
</p>
<p>- to know which equations exists and which are most used in the literature; and
</p>
<p>- to relate development rate with temperature from your empirical data, using the equations from the package database.
</p>


<h3>Installation instructions</h3>

<p><code>install.packages("devRate")</code>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>The package includes two vignettes (long-form documentation):
