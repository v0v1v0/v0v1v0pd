<h2>Methods for Function q in Package ‘distr’</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>q-methods</p>


<h3>Methods</h3>


<dl>
<dt>q</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>signature(save  = "Distribution")</code>: returns the
(left-continuous) quantile function, i.e.;
<code class="reqn">{\rm q}(s)=\inf\{t \,\big|\, P({\tt object}\leq t)\geq s\}</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>q.l</dt>
<dd>
<p><code>signature(object  = "Distribution")</code>: 
from distr-2.6 onwards, we provide this as a synonym for 
method <code>q</code>; this synonym more explicitely states that we are dealing with
the left-continuous variant of a quantile function. It is useful in particular 
when used from the console in RStudio, as RStudio catches calls to 
<code>q()</code> and treats them separately from usual R evaluation.  
The developers of RStudio have been asked to fix this and comply with standard 
R evaluation which explicitely allows overloading <code>q()</code> as we do it in this 
package, but so far have refused to do so, as they claim overloading 
<code>q()</code> was insane.

<pre><code class="language-R">require(distr)
N &lt;- Norm()
q(N)(0.3)
## in RStudio or Jupyter IRKernel, use q.l(.)(.) instead of q(.)(.)
q.l(N)(0.3)
</code></pre>
