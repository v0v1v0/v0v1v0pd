<h2>
AIDS Blood Transfusion Data, doubly truncated
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data include information of transfusions cases of transfusion-related AIDS, corresponding to individuals diagnosed prior to July 1, 1986.  Only 295 patients with consistent data, for which the infection could be attributed to
a single transfusion or short series were included. Since HIV was unknown before 1982, this implies that cases developing AIDS prior to this date were not reported, leading to a doubly truncated data. The incubation time is doubly truncated due to the interval sampling.
