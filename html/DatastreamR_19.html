Expressions can be either PrivateUserGroup or Global. Like the other object types,
PrivateUserGroup items are items created by users and visible to just children of their
Datastream parent ID. PrivateUserGroup expressions have the ID signature Eaaa,

Global expressions are Datastream owned expressions that are available for use by any client.
These have the signature nnnE, where n is a digit.
