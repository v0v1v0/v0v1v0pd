<h2>Data: AIDS patient among IV drug user</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Time to AIDS among 232 patients infected with HIV. 
136 left AIDS-free (right censored). 14 died with AIDS without prior diagnoses (left censored). 
82 had AIDS while in the program (non-censored).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> data(IVaids) </code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A date set with 232 rows and 7 variables.
</p>
<p>"A doubly censoring scheme occurs when the lifetimes T being measured, from a well-known time origin, are exactly observed only within a window [L, R] of observational time and are otherwise censored either from above by R (right-censored observations) or below by L (left-censored observations). 
</p>
<p>Sample data consists on the pairs (U, delta) where U = min[R, max(T, L)] and delta indicates whether T is exactly observed (delta = 0), right-censored (delta = 1) or left-censored (delta = -1). We are interested in the estimation of the marginal behaviour of the three random variables T, L and R based on the observed pairs (U, delta)." —— quote from the below reference paper.
</p>
<p>The definition of the censoring indicator, (delta), here is different from the one we use, (d), in the functions d011( ) and d011ch( ).
</p>
<p>- (delta=0) corresponds to (d=1);
</p>
<p>- (delta=1) corresponds to (d=0);
</p>
<p>- (delta= -1) corresponds to (d=2).
</p>
<p>Therefore we need to make the change before call the function d011( ) or d011ch( ). 
</p>
<p>"The data set is from a cohort of drug users recruited in a detoxification program in Badalona (Spain). For these data we may estimate the survival function for the elapsed time from starting IV-drugs to AIDS diagnosis, as well as the potential follow-up time." ——quote from the below reference paper. 
</p>
<p>The entry "AIDSDate-FIRST_IV" is the observed AIDS-free times, U, in the above definition. The unit of measurement is "days".
</p>
<p>According to the paper the estimated median of U is 15.44 years. And at time of 10 years, the probability of AIDS-free is about 0.7. (from my reading of the plot from the paper, this probability is more closer to 0.75).
