<h2>McMaster Modality Data Set.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing information about <em>students</em>, <em>staff</em>, and <em>faculty</em> commuting to McMaster University.
Data were collected by means of a travel survey in the fall of 2010. Respondents were asked about their mode
of travel to McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. They were also asked about the modes available
to them. The data set also contains relevant attributes about the respondents. The format of the table is wide,
with each row representing an individual respondent. These variables were augmented with information from the
2011 Census of Canada and land use information from local sources.
