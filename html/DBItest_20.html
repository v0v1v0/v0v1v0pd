<h3>Description</h3>

<p>spec_driver_data_type
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>dbDataType()</code> returns the SQL type that corresponds to the <code>obj</code> argument
as a non-empty
character string.
For data frames, a character vector with one element per column
is returned.
</p>


<h3>Failure modes</h3>

<p>An error is raised for invalid values for the <code>obj</code> argument such as a
<code>NULL</code> value.
</p>


<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>The backend can override the <code>dbDataType()</code> generic
for its driver class.
</p>
<p>This generic expects an arbitrary object as second argument.
To query the values returned by the default implementation,
run <code>example(dbDataType, package = "DBI")</code>.
If the backend needs to override this generic,
it must accept all basic R data types as its second argument, namely
logical,
integer,
numeric,
character,
dates (see Dates),
date-time (see DateTimeClasses),
and difftime.
If the database supports blobs,
this method also must accept lists of raw vectors,
and blob::blob objects.
As-is objects (i.e., wrapped by <code>I()</code>) must be
supported and return the same results as their unwrapped counterparts.
The SQL data type for factor and
ordered is the same as for character.
The behavior for other object types is not specified.
