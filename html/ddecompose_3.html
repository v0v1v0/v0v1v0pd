<h2>DFL reweighting decomposition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>dfl_decompose</code> divides between-group differences in distributional
statistics of an outcome variable into a structure effect and a composition
effect. Following DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996), the procedure reweights
the sample distribution of a reference group such that the group's covariates
distribution matches the covariates distribution of a comparison group.
</p>
<p>The function derives counterfactual distributions with inverse probability
weigthing. Reweighting factors are estimate by modelling the probability of
belonging to the comparison group conditional on covariates.
</p>
<p>The function allows detailed decompositions of the composition effect by
sequentially reweighting (conditional) covariate distributions. Standard
errors can be bootstrapped.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The observed difference to be decomposed equals the difference between the values
of the distributional statistic of <code>group</code> 1 and <code>group</code> 0, respectively:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Delta_O = \nu_1 - \nu_0,</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\nu_t = \nu(F_g)</code> denotes the statistics of the outcome distribution
<code class="reqn">F_g</code> of group <code class="reqn">g</code>. Group 0 is identified by the lower ranked value
of the <code>group</code> variable.
</p>
<p>If <code>reference_0=TRUE</code>, then group 0 is the reference group and its observations
are reweighted such that they match the covariates distribution of group 1, the
comparison group. The counterfactual combines the covariates distribution
<code class="reqn">F_1(x)</code> of group 1 with the conditional outcome distribution <code class="reqn">F_0(y|x)</code>
of group 0 and is derived by reweighting group 0
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F_C(y) = \int F_0(y|x) dF_1(x) = \int F_0(y|x) \Psi(x) dF_0(x),</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\Psi(x)</code> is the reweighting factor, i.e., the inverse probabilities
of belonging to the comparison group conditional on covariates x.
</p>
<p>The distributional statistic of the counterfactual distribution,
<code class="reqn">\nu_C = \nu(F_C)</code>, allows to decompose the observed difference into
a (wage) structure effect (<code class="reqn">\Delta_S = \nu_1 - \nu_C</code>) and a
composition effect (<code class="reqn">\Delta_C = \nu_C - \nu_0</code>).
</p>
<p>If <code>reference_0=FALSE</code>, then the counterfactual is derived by combining
the covariates distribution of group 0 with the conditional outcome
distribution of group 1 and, thus, reweighting group 1
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F_C(y) = \int F_1(y|x) dF_0(x) = \int F_1(y|x) \Psi(x) dF_1(x).</code>
</p>

<p>The composition effect becomes <code class="reqn">\Delta_C = \nu_1 - \nu_C</code> and the
structure effect <code class="reqn">\Delta_S = \nu_C - \nu_0</code>, respectively.
</p>
<p>The covariates are defined in <code>formula</code>. The reweighting factor is
estimated in the pooled sample with observations from both groups. <code>method = "logit"</code>
uses a logit model to fit the conditional probabilities. <code>method = "fastglm"</code>
also fits a logit model but with a faster algorithm from <strong>fastglm</strong>.
<code>method = "random_forest"</code> uses the <strong>Ranger</strong> implementation of
the random forests classifier.
</p>
<p>The counterfactual statistics are then estimated with the observed data of
the reference group and the fitted reweighting factors.
</p>
<p><code>formula</code> allows to specify interaction terms in the conditional
probability models. If you are interested in an aggregate decomposition,
then all covariates have to be entered at once, e.g., <code>Y ~ X + Z</code>.
</p>
<p>The procedure allows for sequential decomposition of the composition effect.
In this case, more than one reweighting factor based on different sets of
covariates are estimated.
</p>
<p>If you are interested in a sequential decomposition, the decomposition
sequence has to be distinguished by the <code>|</code> operator in the <code>formula</code>
object. For instance, <code>Y ~ X | Z</code> would decompose the aggregate composition
effect into the contribution of covariate(s) X and the one of covariate(s) Z,
respectively.
</p>
<p>In this two-fold sequential decomposition, we have the detailed composition
effects
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Delta_{C_X} = \nu_1 - \nu_{CX},</code>
</p>

<p>and
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\Delta_{C_Z} = \nu_{CX} - \nu_C,</code>
</p>

<p>which sum up to the aggregate composition effect <code class="reqn">\Delta_C</code>.
<code class="reqn">\nu_C</code> is defined as above. It captures the contribution of all
covariates (i.e., X and Z). In contrast, <code class="reqn">\nu_{CX}</code> corresponds
to the statistic of the counterfactual distribution isolating the contribution
of covariate(s) X in contrast to the one of covariate(s) Z.
</p>
<p>If <code>right_to_left=TRUE</code>, then the counterfactual is defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F_{CX}(y) = \iint F_0(y|x,z) dF_0(x|z) dF_1(z),</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">F_1(x|z)</code> is the conditional distribution of X given Z of
group 1 and <code class="reqn">F_0(z)</code> the distribution of Z. If <code>right_to_left=FALSE</code>,
we have
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">F_{CX}(y) = \iint F_0(y|x,z) dF_1(x|z) dF_0(z).</code>
</p>

<p>Note that it is possible to specify the detailed models in every part of <code>formula</code>.
This is useful if you want to estimate in every step a fully saturated model,
e.g., <code>Y ~ X * Z | Z</code>. If not further specified, the variables are
additively included in the model used to derived the aggregate reweighting
factor.
</p>
<p>The detailed decomposition terms are path-dependent. The results depend on the sequence
the covariates enter the decomposition (e.g, <code>Y ~ X | Z</code> yields different
detailed decomposition terms than <code>Y ~ Z | X</code>) . Even for the same sequence,
the results differ depending on the 'direction' of the decomposition. In
the example above using <code>right_to_left=TRUE</code>, the contribution of Z is evaluated
using the conditional distribution of X given Z from group 0. If we use
<code>right_to_left=FALSE</code> instead, the same contribution is evaluated using
the conditional distribution from group 1.
</p>
<p>Per default, the distributional statistics for which the between group differences
are decomposed are quantiles, the mean, the variance, the Gini coefficient
and the interquantile range between the 9th and the 1st decile, the 9th decile
and the median, and the median and the first decile, respectively. The interquantile
ratios between the same quantiles are implemented, as well.
</p>
<p>The quantiles can be specified by <code>probs</code> that sets the corresponding
probabilities of the quantiles of interest. For other distributional statistics,
please use <code>custom_statistic_function</code>
</p>
<p>The function bootstraps standard errors and derives a bootstrapped Kolmogorov-Smirnov
distribution to construct uniform confindence bands. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov distribution
is estimated as in Chen et al. (2017).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

factors and a list with standard errors for the decomposition terms, the
