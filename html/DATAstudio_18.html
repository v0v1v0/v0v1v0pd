<h2>Metabolic Syndrome Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>metsynd</code> data includes Gamma-Glutamyl Transferase (GGT)
levels and curves of arterial oxygen saturation, for samples of women
suffering from metabolic syndrome and women without metabolic
syndrome; the data were gathered from a population-based survey
conducted in Galicia (NW Spain), and it includes 35 women suffering
from metabolic syndrome and 80 women without metabolic syndrome.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">metsynd</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The data consist of a list with the following elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><code>y0</code>: 
GGT levels for women without metabolic syndrome.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>y1</code>: 
GGT levels for women suffering from metabolic syndrome.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X0</code>: 
Curves of arterial oxygen saturation (%) for women without
metabolic syndrome (<code>X0$data</code>, <code>X0$time</code>).

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>X1</code>: 
Curves of arterial oxygen saturation (%) for women suffering from
metabolic syndrome (<code>X1$data</code>, <code>X1$time</code>).      

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The curves of arterial oxygen saturation are included in the matrices
<code>X0$data</code> and <code>X1$data</code>, with each row representing a
patient, and with columns representing ordered measurements over time.
Here <code>X0$time</code> and <code>X1$time</code> represents the time (in hours) at
which measurements were made, i.e., every 20 seconds during three
hours of sleep. Further details on these data can be found in the
references below.
