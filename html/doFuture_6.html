<h2>Use the Foreach <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> Adapter with Futures</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>registerDoFuture()</code> function makes the
<code>%dopar%</code> operator of the
<span class="pkg">foreach</span> package to process foreach iterations via any of
the future backends supported by the <span class="pkg">future</span> package, which
includes various parallel and distributed backends.
In other words, <em>if a computational backend is supported via
the Future API, it'll be automatically available for all functions
and packages making using the <span class="pkg">foreach</span> framework.</em>
Neither the developer nor the end user has to change any code.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">registerDoFuture()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>registerDoFuture()</code> returns, invisibly, the previously registered
foreach <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> backend.
</p>


<h3>Parallel backends</h3>

<p>To use futures with the <span class="pkg">foreach</span> package and its
<code>%dopar%</code> operator, use
<code>doFuture::registerDoFuture()</code> to register <span class="pkg">doFuture</span> to be
used as a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> adapter.  After this, <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> will
parallelize with whatever <span class="pkg">future</span> backend is set by
<code>future::plan()</code>.
</p>
<p>The built-in <span class="pkg">future</span> backends are always available, e.g.
sequential (sequential processing),
multicore (forked processes),
multisession (background R sessions),
and cluster (background R sessions on
local and remote machines).
For example, <code>plan(multisession)</code> will make <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code>
parallelize via R processes running in the background on the
local machine, and
<code>plan(cluster, workers = c("n1", "n2", "n2", "n3"))</code> will
parallelize via R processes running on external machines.
</p>
<p>Additional backends are provided by other future-compliant
packages.  For example, the <span class="pkg">future.batchtools</span> package
provides support for high-performance compute (HPC) cluster
schedulers such as SGE, Slurm, and TORQUE / PBS.
As an illustration, <code>plan(batchtools_slurm)</code> will parallelize
by submitting the foreach iterations as tasks to the Slurm
scheduler, which in turn will distribute the tasks to one
or more compute nodes.
</p>


<h3>Global variables and packages</h3>

<p>Unless running locally in the global environment (= at the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> prompt),
the <span class="pkg">foreach</span> package requires you do specify what global variables
and packages need to be available and attached in order for the
"foreach" expression to be evaluated properly.  It is not uncommon to
get errors on one or missing variables when moving from running a
<code>res &lt;- foreach() %dopar% { ... }</code> statement on the local machine
to, say, another machine on the same network.  The solution to the
problem is to explicitly export those variables by specifying them in
the <code>.export</code> argument to <code>foreach::foreach()</code>,
e.g. <code>foreach(..., .export = c("mu", "sigma"))</code>.  Likewise, if the
expression needs specific packages to be attached, they can be listed
in argument <code>.packages</code> of <code>foreach()</code>.
</p>
<p>When using <code>registerDoFuture()</code>, the above becomes less
critical, because by default the Future API identifies all globals and
all packages automatically (via static code inspection).  This is done
exactly the same way regardless of future backend.
This automatic identification of globals and packages is illustrated
by the below example, which does <em>not</em> specify
<code>.export = c("my_stat")</code>.  This works because the future framework
detects that function <code>my_stat()</code> is needed and makes sure it is
exported.  If you would use, say, <code>cl &lt;- parallel::makeCluster(2)</code>
and <code>doParallel::registerDoParallel(cl)</code>, you would get a run-time
error on <code>Error in { : task 1 failed - \"could not find function "my_stat" ...</code>.
</p>
<p>Having said this, note that, in order for your "foreach" code to work
everywhere and with other types of foreach adapters as well, you may
want to make sure that you always specify arguments <code>.export</code>
and <code>.packages</code>.
</p>


<h3>Load balancing ("chunking")</h3>

<p>Whether load balancing ("chunking") should take place or not can be
controlled by specifying either argument
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠.options.future = list(scheduling = &lt;ratio&gt;)⁠</code> or
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠.options.future = list(chunk.size = &lt;count&gt;)⁠</code> to <code>foreach()</code>.
</p>
<p>The value <code>chunk.size</code> specifies the average number of elements
processed per future ("chunks").
If <code>+Inf</code>, then all elements are processed in a single future (one worker).
If <code>NULL</code>, then argument <code>future.scheduling</code> is used.
</p>
<p>The value <code>scheduling</code> specifies the average number of futures
("chunks") that each worker processes.
If <code>0.0</code>, then a single future is used to process all iterations;
none of the other workers are not used.
If <code>1.0</code> or <code>TRUE</code>, then one future per worker is used.
If <code>2.0</code>, then each worker will process two futures (if there are
enough iterations).
If <code>+Inf</code> or <code>FALSE</code>, then one future per iteration is used.
The default value is <code>scheduling = 1.0</code>.
</p>
<p>The name of <code>foreach()</code> argument <code>.options.future</code> follows the naming
conventions of the <span class="pkg">doMC</span>, <span class="pkg">doSNOW</span>, and <span class="pkg">doParallel</span> packages,
<em>This argument should not be mistaken for the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>
options of the future package</em>.
</p>
<p>For backward-compatibility reasons with existing foreach code, one may
also use arguments <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠.options.multicore = list(preschedule = &lt;logical&gt;)⁠</code> and
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠.options.snow = list(preschedule = &lt;logical&gt;)⁠</code> when using <span class="pkg">doFuture</span>.
<code>.options.multicore = list(preschedule = TRUE)</code> is equivalent to
<code>.options.future = list(scheduling = 1.0)</code> and
<code>.options.multicore = list(preschedule = FALSE)</code> is equivalent to
<code>.options.future = list(scheduling = +Inf)</code>.
and analogously for <code>.options.snow</code>.
Argument <code>.options.future</code> takes precedence over argument
<code>.option.multicore</code> which takes precedence over argument <code>.option.snow</code>,
when it comes to chunking.
</p>


<h3>Random Number Generation (RNG)</h3>

<p>The doFuture adapter registered by <code>registerDoFuture()</code> does <em>not</em> itself
provide a framework for generating proper random numbers in parallel.
This is a deliberate design choice based on how the foreach ecosystem is
set up and to align it with other foreach adapters, e.g. <strong>doParallel</strong>.
To generate statistically sound parallel RNG, it is recommended to use
the <span class="pkg">doRNG</span> package, where the <code>%dorng%</code>
operator is used in place of <code>%dopar%</code>.
For example,
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>y &lt;- foreach(i = 1:3) %dorng% {
  rnorm(1)
}
</pre></div>
<p>This works because <span class="pkg">doRNG</span> is designed to work with any type of foreach
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> adapter including the one provided by <span class="pkg">doFuture</span>.
</p>
<p>If you forget to use <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dorng%⁠</code> instead of <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠%dopar%⁠</code> when the foreach
iteration generates random numbers, <span class="pkg">doFuture</span> will detect the
mistake and produce an informative warning.
</p>


<h3>For package developers</h3>

<p>Please refrain from modifying the foreach backend inside your package or
functions, i.e. do not call any <code>registerNnn()</code> in your code.  Instead,
leave the control on what backend to use to the end user.  This idea is
part of the core philosophy of the <span class="pkg">foreach</span> framework.
</p>
<p>However, if you think it necessary to register the <span class="pkg">doFuture</span> backend
in a function, please make sure to undo your changes when exiting the
function. This can be done using:
</p>
<pre>
  oldDoPar &lt;- registerDoFuture()
  on.exit(with(oldDoPar, foreach::setDoPar(fun=fun, data=data, info=info)), add = TRUE)
  [...]
</pre>
<p>This is important, because the end-user might have already registered a
foreach backend elsewhere for other purposes and will most likely not known
that calling your function will break their setup.
<em>Remember, your package and its functions might be used in a greater
context where multiple packages and functions are involved and those might
also rely on the foreach framework, so it is important to avoid stepping on
others' toes.</em>
</p>


<h3>Reporting on progress</h3>

<p>How to report on progress is a frequently asked question, especially
in long-running tasks and parallel processing.  The <strong>foreach</strong>
framework does <em>not</em> have a built-in mechanism for progress
reporting(*).
</p>
<p>When using <strong>doFuture</strong>, and the Futureverse in general, for
processing, the <strong>progressr</strong> package can be used to signal progress
updates in a near-live fashion.  There is special argument related to
<code>foreach()</code> or <strong>doFuture</strong> to achieve this. Instead, one calls a
a, so called, "progressor" function within each iteration.  See
the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/package=progressr"><strong>progressr</strong></a>
package and its <code>vignette(package = "progressr")</code> for examples.
</p>
<p>(*) The legacy <strong>doSNOW</strong> package uses a special <code>foreach()</code> argument
<code>.options.doSNOW$progress</code> that can be used to make a progress update
each time results from a parallel workers is returned. This approach
is limited by how chunking works, requires the developer to set that
argument, and the code becomes incompatible with foreach adaptors
registered by other <strong>doNnn</strong> packages.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
library(iterators)  # iter()
registerDoFuture()  # (a) tell %dopar% to use the future framework
plan(multisession)  # (b) parallelize futures on the local machine


## Example 1
A &lt;- matrix(rnorm(100^2), nrow = 100)
B &lt;- t(A)

y1 &lt;- apply(B, MARGIN = 2L, FUN = function(b) {
  A %*% b
})

y2 &lt;- foreach(b = iter(B, by = "col"), .combine = cbind) %dopar% {
  A %*% b
}
stopifnot(all.equal(y2, y1))



## Example 2 - Chunking (4 elements per future [= worker])
y3 &lt;- foreach(b = iter(B, by = "col"), .combine = cbind,
              .options.future = list(chunk.size = 10)) %dopar% {
  A %*% b
}
stopifnot(all.equal(y3, y1))


## Example 3 - Simulation with parallel RNG
library(doRNG)

my_stat &lt;- function(x) {
  median(x)
}

my_experiment &lt;- function(n, mu = 0.0, sigma = 1.0) {
  ## Important: use %dorng% whenever random numbers
  ##            are involved in parallel evaluation
  foreach(i = 1:n) %dorng% {
    x &lt;- rnorm(i, mean = mu, sd = sigma)
    list(mu = mean(x), sigma = sd(x), own = my_stat(x))
  }
}

## Reproducible results when using the same RNG seed
set.seed(0xBEEF)
y1 &lt;- my_experiment(n = 3)

set.seed(0xBEEF)
y2 &lt;- my_experiment(n = 3)

stopifnot(identical(y2, y1))

## But only then
y3 &lt;- my_experiment(n = 3)
str(y3)
stopifnot(!identical(y3, y1))
