<h2>dataMeta: Create and Append a Data Dictionary for an R Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataMeta package provides three main functions:
build_linker, build_dict and incorporate_attr. The build_linker and incorporate_attr functions have prompt options called:
prompt_linker and prompt_attr, respectively.
</p>


<h3>dataMeta functions</h3>

<p>build_linker This function will  build a data frame that will serve as a link between your dataset to the creation of the data dictionary.
prompt_linker This function is an alternate function to build the linker. It will prompt you for variable name descriptions in real time.
build_dict This function will build a data dictionary using the linker and the original dataset.
incorporate_attr This function will incorporate the data dictionary that is created with the build_dict option into the R dataset as an attribute, along with other metadata that may be needed.
prompt_attr This function will prompt the user for options related to the metadata that will be added to the R dataset. This is an alternative to the incorporate_attr function.
save_it This function will save your new data with its attributes as an R dataset.
