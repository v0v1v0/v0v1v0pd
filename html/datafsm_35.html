<h2>Variable Importance Measure for A FSM Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>var_imp</code> calculates the importance of the covariates of the model.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">var_imp(state_mat, action_vec, data, outcome, period, measure)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state_mat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric matrix with rows as states and columns as
predictors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>action_vec</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector indicating what action to take for each
state.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame that has "period" and "outcome" columns and rest of
cols are predictors, ranging from one to three predictors. All of the (3-5
columns) should be named.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector same length as the number of rows as data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric vector same length as the number of rows as data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measure</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional length one character vector that is either:
"accuracy", "sens", "spec", or "ppv". This specifies what measure of
predictive performance to use for training and evaluating the model. The
default measure is <code>"accuracy"</code>. However, accuracy can be a problematic
measure when the classes are imbalanced in the samples, i.e. if a class the
model is trying to predict is very rare. Alternatives to accuracy are
available that illuminate different aspects of predictive power. Sensitivity
answers the question, “ given that a result is truly an event, what is the
probability that the model will predict an event?” Specificity answers the
question, “given that a result is truly not an event, what is the
probability that the model will predict a negative?” Positive predictive
value answers, “what is the percent of predicted positives that are
actually positive?”</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Takes the state matrix and action vector from an already evolved model and
the fitness function and data used to evolve the model (or this could be test
data), flips the values of each of the elements in the state matrix and
measures the change in fitness (prediction of data) relative to the original
model. Then these changes are summed across columns to provide the importance
of each of the columns of the state matrix.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Numeric vector the same length as the number of columns of the
provided state matrix (the number of predictors in the model) with relative
importance scores for each predictor.
