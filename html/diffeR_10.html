<h2>
calculates difference metrics between a reference map and a comparison map both consecutively aggregated at multiple resolutions
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>calculates quantity, exchange and shift components of difference, as well as the overall difference, between a comparison raster map (or map at time <em>t</em>), and a reference raster map (or map at time <em>t</em>+1), both consecutively aggregated at multiple resolutions.  
</p>
<p>Quantity difference is defined as the amount of difference between the reference map and a comparison map that is due to the less than maximum match in the proportions of the categories. Exchange consists of a transition from category <em>i</em> to category <em>j</em> in some pixels and a transition from category <em>j</em> to category <em>i</em> in an identical number of other pixels. Shift refers to the difference remaining after subtracting quantity difference and exchange from the overall difference.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">differenceMR(comp, ref, eval = "multiple", percent = TRUE, fact = 2, 
             population = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comp</code></td>
<td>

<p>object of class SpatRaster corresponding to the comparison map, or map at time <em>t</em>
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ref</code></td>
<td>

<p>object of class SpatRaster corresponding to the reference map, or map at time <em>t</em>+1
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>eval</code></td>
<td>

<p>default "original", return difference metrics between the input raster maps at the original resolution; if "multiple", return difference metrics at multiple resolutions aggregated according to a geometric sequence 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>percent</code></td>
<td>

<p>logical. If TRUE, output value is given as percentage. If FALSE, output value is given as proportion (0 to 1)
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fact</code></td>
<td>

<p>positive integer. Aggregation factor expressed as number of cells in each direction (horizontally and vertically). Or two integers (horizontal and vertical aggregation factor). See <code>aggregate()</code> in the <code>terra</code> package for details
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>population</code></td>
<td>

<p>an <em>n</em> x 2 matrix provided to correct the sample count to population count in the square contingency table. See Details below
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For correcting the sample count to population count in the square contingency table, assuming a stratified random sampling, an <em>n</em> (number of categories) by 2 matrix can be provided in the <code>population</code> argument. The first column of <code>population</code> must contains integer identifiers of each category, corresponding to the categories in the comparison map (or map at time <em>t</em>) and reference map (or map at time <em>t</em>+1). The second column corresponds to the population totals for each map category  
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>data.frame containing quantity, exchange and shift components of difference, as well as the overall difference, between the comparison map and the reference map at multiple resolutions
