<h2>Numeric Approximation of Continuous Decomposition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an exact R implementation of the decomposition code in Matlab offered by the authors in
the supplementary material given here: &lt;http://www.demog.berkeley.edu/~jrw/Papers/decomp.suppl.pdf&gt;. The 
difference between <code>DecompContinuous()</code> and this function is that <code>DecompContinuousOrig</code> takes 
<code>rates1</code> and <code>rates2</code> as single vectors, rather than as matrices, and output is also returned as a
vector. This difference makes the function more flexible, but may add a step when writing the function to
be decomposed. See examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">horiuchi(func, pars1, pars2, N, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>func</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function specified by the user. This must be able to take the vectors <code>rates1</code> or 
<code>rates2</code> as its argument, and to return the value of the function, <code>y</code>, when evaluated for 
these rates. It may also have additional arguments, not to be decomposed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pars1</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of covariates to be passed on as arguments to <code>func()</code>. Covariates
can be in any order, as long as <code>func()</code> knows what to do with them. <code>pars1</code> is for time 1 
(or population 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pars2</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the same as <code>pars2</code> but for time/population 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of intervals to integrate over.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>optional parameters to pass on to <code>func()</code>. These are not decomposed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The decomposition works by assuming a linear change in all parameters between <code>pars1</code> and <code>pars2</code>. At each small step approaching time 2 (the size of which is <code>1/N</code>) each parameter is moved forward along its linear trajectory. One at a time, each covariate (of which there are ages*variables of) is switched out twice, once for its value at 1/(2N) forward and once for its value at 1/(2N) backward in time. The difference between <code>func()</code> evaluated with these two rate matrices is the change in <code>y</code>attributable to that particular covariate and that particular time step. Summing over all N time steps, we get the contribution to the difference of each covariate, <code>effectmat</code>. The sum of <code>effectmat</code> should come very close to <code>func(rates2)-func(rates1)</code>. The error decreases with larger <code>N</code>, but there is not much point in having an <code>N</code> higher than 100, and 20 is usually sufficient. This ought to be able to handle a very wide variety of functions. 
</p>
<p>If <code>pars1</code> are observations from 2005 and <code>pars2</code> are observations from 2006 an <code>N</code> of 20 would imply a delta of 1/20 of a year for each integration step. Higher <code>N</code> provides finer results (a lower total residual), but takes longer to compute. In general, there are decreasing returns to higher <code>N</code>. <code>sum(effectmat)</code> ought to approximate <code>func(rates2)-func(rates1)</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns <code>effectmat</code>, a matrix of the variable effects that is organized in the same way as <code>pars1</code> and <code>pars2</code>.
