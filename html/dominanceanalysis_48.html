<h2>Distribution of a tropical native bird species inhabiting a small oceanic island.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The dataset contains information about points distributed across a small oceanic island (Soares, 2017).
In each of these points, a 10-minute count was carried out to record the species presence
(assuming 1 if the species was present, or 0 if it was absent). The species'
presence/absence is the binary response variable (i.e., dependent variable).
Additionally, all sampled points were characterized by multiple environmental variables.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 2398 rows and 8 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ID</dt>
<dd>
<p>Point identification</p>
</dd>
<dt>rem</dt>
<dd>
<p>remoteness is an index that represents the difficulty of movement through the landscape, with the highest values corresponding to the most remote areas</p>
</dd>
<dt>land</dt>
<dd>
<p>land use is an index that represents the land-use intensification, with the highest values corresponding to the more humanized areas (e.g., cities, agricultural areas, horticultures, oil-palm monocultures)</p>
</dd>
<dt>alt</dt>
<dd>
<p>altitude is a continuous variable, with the highest values corresponding to the higher altitude areas</p>
</dd>
<dt>slo</dt>
<dd>
<p>slope is a continuous variable, with the highest values corresponding to the steepest areas</p>
</dd>
<dt>rain</dt>
<dd>
<p>rainfall is a continuous variable, with the highest values corresponding to the rainy wet areas</p>
</dd>
<dt>coast</dt>
<dd>
<p>distance to the coast is the minimum linear distance between each point and the coast line, with the highest values corresponding to the points further away from the coastline</p>
</dd>
<dt>pres</dt>
<dd>
<p>Species presence</p>
</dd>
</dl>
