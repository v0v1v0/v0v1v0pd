<h2>
A 2-stage SMART data of children with ADHD
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>We provide a two-stage sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) data of 150 children with ADHD mimicking a real world study. At the first stage, children were randomized to treatment of low-intensity behavioral modification (BMOD) or low-intensity methamphetamine (MED) with equal probability. At second stage, children were randomized to treatment of low-intensity BMOD + low-intensity MED, or high-intensity BMOD with equal probability. The primary outcome of study was children's school performance score ranging from 1 to 5 assessed at the end of the study for all participants.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("adhd")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 150 observations on the following 11 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>id</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>IDs of the 150 children</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o11</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>baseline covariate coded as 0/1: diagnosed with ODD (oppositional defiant disorder) before the first-stage intervention</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o12</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>baseline covariate: ADHD score at the end of the previous school year (ranging from 0 to 3, larger values for fewer ADHD symptoms)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o13</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>baseline covariate coded as 0/1: receiving medication during the previous school year</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o14</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>baseline covariate coded as 0/1: race - white (coded 1) versus nonwhite (coded 0)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>a1</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>first-stage intervention coded as -1/1: -1 for low-intensity methamphetamine (MEDS), 1 for low-intensity behavioral modification (BMOD)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>r</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>first-stage response indicator coded as 0/1</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o21</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>intermediate outcome: number of months until non-response (maximum: 8 months, NA for responders)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>o22</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>intermediate outcome coded as 0/1: adherence to the first-stage intervention, 1 for high adherence</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>a2</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>second-stage intervention coded as -1/1: -1 for low-intensity BMOD + MEDS, 1 for high-intensity BMOD</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>y</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>primary outcome (continuous): school performance at the end of the school year (ranging from 1 to 5, higher values reflect better performance)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
