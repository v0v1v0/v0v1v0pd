<h2>Euro Area Macroeconomic Data from Banbura and Modugno 2014</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data extract from BM 2014 replication files. Some proprietary series (mostly PMI's) are excluded. The dataset <code>BM14_Models</code> provides information about all series
and their inclusion in the 'small', 'medium' and 'large' sized dynamic factor models estimated by BM 2014. The actual data is contained in <em>xts</em> format in <code>BM14_M</code> for monthly data and <code>BM14_Q</code> for quarterly data.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BM14_Models
BM14_M
BM14_Q
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>BM14_Models</code> is a data frame with 101 obs. (series) and 8 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>series</dt>
<dd>
<p>BM14 series code (converted to snake case for R)</p>
</dd>
<dt>label</dt>
<dd>
<p>BM14 series label</p>
</dd>
<dt>code</dt>
<dd>
<p>original series code from data source</p>
</dd>
<dt>freq</dt>
<dd>
<p>series frequency</p>
</dd>
<dt>log_trans</dt>
<dd>
<p>logical indicating whether the series was transformed by the natural log before differencing. Note that all data are provided in untransformed levels, and all data was (log-)differenced by BM14 before estimation.</p>
</dd>
<dt>small</dt>
<dd>
<p>logical indicating series included in the 'small' model of BM14. Proprietary series are excluded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>medium</dt>
<dd>
<p>logical indicating series included in the 'medium' model of BM14. Proprietary series are excluded.</p>
</dd>
<dt>large</dt>
<dd>
<p>logical indicating series included in the 'large' model of BM14. This comprises all series, thus the variable is redundant but included for completeness. Proprietary series are excluded.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
