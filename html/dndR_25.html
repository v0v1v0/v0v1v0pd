<h2>Creates a Monster for Given Party Level and Size</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the vital statistics of a randomized monster based on a the average player level and number of players in the party. This function follows the advice of [Zee Bashew](https://twitter.com/Zeebashew) on how to build interesting, challenging monsters for your party. These monsters are built somewhat according to the Dungeon Master's Guide for creating monsters, partly Zee's [YouTube video on homebrewing monsters based on The Witcher videogame](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GhjkPv4qo5w), and partly on my own sensibilities about scaling the difficulty of a creature. Creatures are spawned randomly so you may need to re-run the function several times (or mentally modify one or more parts of the output) to get a monster that fits your campaign and players, but the vulnerabilities and resistances should allow for cool quest building around what this function provides. Happy DMing!
