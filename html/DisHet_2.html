<h2>Empirically-defined Immune Signature Genes in RCC Bulk Tumor
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Based on DisHet analysis of 35 RCC trio RNA-Seq data, we defined immune-specific genes with empirical evidence, named eTME, for empirically-defined immune signature of tumor. Using eTME, we refined previously published Immunome signatures. We also assigned other eTME genes to specific immune cell types using the BLUEPRINT project data. These two sets of refined gene signatures were consolidated and documented in the DisHet R package as the "eTME" immune cell gene signatures.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("eTME_signatures")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A List contains 2 lists of signatures:the 1st list "signatures_gene" contains the signatures on gene level, and the 2nd list "signatures_mRNA" contains the signatures on mRNA level. Both lists contain 25 items/vectors.
