<h2>Calculate Player Character (PC) Level from Current Experience Points (XP)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Uses total player experience points (XP) to identify player character (PC) level and proficiency modifier. Only works for a single PC at a time (though this is unlikely to be an issue if all party members have the same amount of XP). Big thanks to Humberto Nappo for contributing this function!
