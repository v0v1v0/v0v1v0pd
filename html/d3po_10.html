<h3>Description</h3>

<p>World, continent and country maps. These maps are provided as R lists
structured by following the 'topojson' standard. The maps are organized in
sub-lists by continent and here I provide maps for both the continents and
the countries. There are missing states or regions because those could not be
found in the original maps.
