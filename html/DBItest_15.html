<h3>DBI classes and methods</h3>

<p>A backend defines three classes,
which are subclasses of
DBIDriver,
DBIConnection,
and DBIResult.
The backend provides implementation for all methods
of these base classes
that are defined but not implemented by DBI.
All methods defined in <span class="pkg">DBI</span> are reexported (so that the package can
be used without having to attach <span class="pkg">DBI</span>),
and have an ellipsis <code>...</code> in their formals for extensibility.
