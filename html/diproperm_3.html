<h2>Classification data from Audobon Society Field Guide (1981)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to
23 species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota family. Each
species is identified as definitely edible, definitely
poisonous, or of unknown edibility and not recommended. The unknown class was
combined with the poisonous class such that there were two classes: definitely
edible and poisonous/unknown.

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list (<code>X</code>) containing a 112x8124 matrix of 8124 mushrooms with 112

The 112 features are
0/1 dummy variables for 22 different categorical attributes. All 22 attributes and their
