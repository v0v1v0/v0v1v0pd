<h2>Identify columns that are included in others</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Find all the columns that don't contain more information than another column. For example if
you have a column with an amount and another with the same amount but rounded, the second
column is included in the first.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">which_are_included(data_set, keep_cols = NULL, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_set</code></td>
<td>
<p>Matrix, data.frame or data.table</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep_cols</code></td>
<td>
<p>List of columns not to drop (list of character, default to NULL)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the algorithm talk (logical, default to TRUE)</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is performing exponential search and is looking to every couple of columns. <br>
Be very careful while using this function: <br>
- if there is an id column, it will say everything is included in the id column; <br>
- the order of columns will influence the result.<br><br>
For example if
you have a column with an amount and another with the same amount but rounded, the second
column is included in the first.<br><br>
And last but not least, with some machine learning algorithm it's not always smart to drop
columns even if they don't give more info: the extreme example is the id example.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of index of columns that have an exact duplicate in the <code>data_set</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Load toy data set
require(data.table)
data(tiny_messy_adult)

# Check for included columns
which_are_included(tiny_messy_adult)

# Return columns that are also constant, double and bijection
# Let's add a truly just included column
tiny_messy_adult$are50OrMore &lt;- tiny_messy_adult$age &gt; 50
which_are_included(tiny_messy_adult[, .(age, are50OrMore)])

# As one can, see this column that doesn't have additional info than age is spotted.

# But you should be careful, if there is a column id, every column will be dropped:
tiny_messy_adult$id = seq_len(nrow(tiny_messy_adult)) # build id
which_are_included(tiny_messy_adult)
</code></pre>
