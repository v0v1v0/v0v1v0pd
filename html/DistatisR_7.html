<h2>7 (fictitious) assessors sort and verbally describe 7 Beers using
<em>Projective Mapping</em>.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>BeersProjectiveMapping</code>:
7 (fictitious) assessors evaluated 7 Beers using
<em>Projective Mapping</em> (with verbal description).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("BeersProjectiveMapping")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a list with 3 elements:
1) <code>ProjectiveMapping</code>: 
a matrix of dimensions 7 beers by  7*2 
assessors-dimensions of the coordinates of the beers on the sheet
of paper;
2) <code>Vocabulary</code>: a Beers (rows) by Assessors (columns)
data.frame 
where each element of <code>Vocabulary</code>
stores
the words used by one assessor to describe a beer
(words are separated with spaces);
and 3) <code>CT.vocabulary</code> a matrix storing
the  <code class="reqn">I</code> Products by <code class="reqn">N</code> 
words (from the Vocabulary) contingency table,
in  <code>CT.vocabulary</code> the number at the intersection
of a row (beer) and a column (word) is the number
of assessors who used this word to describe that beer.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>First, Each assessor positioned the 7 beers on a sheet
of paper according to the perceived similarity between the beers.
For each assessor, the position of the beers was recorded
from the <code class="reqn">X</code> and <code class="reqn">Y</code> coordinates. 
Second, the assessors were asked if they could describe each
beer with some freely chosen descriptors. 
These descriptors
are stored in a dataframe with 7 elements (one per assessor)
where each element of the dataframe
is a 7 component vector (one per beer) where each element stores
the words used to describe a beer 
(words are separated with spaces).
