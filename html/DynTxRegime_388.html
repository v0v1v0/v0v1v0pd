<h2>Adolescent BMI dataset (generated toy example)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset generated to mimic data from a two-stage randomized clinical trial 
that studied the effect of meal replacement shakes on adolescent obesity. 
The dataset contains the following covariates collected at the start of the 
first stage: "gender," "race," "parentBMI," and "baselineBMI." At the 
second-stage, "month4BMI" was collected. Variables "A1" and "A2" are the 
randomized treatments at stages one and two, and "month12BMI" is the primary 
outcome collected at the end of stage two.
