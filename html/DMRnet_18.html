<h2>promoter dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It consists of E. coli promoter gene sequences starting at position -50 (p-50) and ending at position +7 (p7). Each of these 57 Fields is filled by one of a, g, t, c. The task is to recognize promoters, which are genetic regions which initiate the first step in the expression of adjacent genes (transcription). There are 53 promoters and 53 non-promoter sequences.
