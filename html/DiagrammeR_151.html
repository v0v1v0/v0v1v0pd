<h2>Get paths from a specified node in a directed graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Obtain a list of all possible paths from a given node within a directed
graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_paths(
  graph,
  from = NULL,
  to = NULL,
  shortest_path = FALSE,
  longest_path = FALSE,
  distance = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph object of class <code>dgr_graph</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>from</code></td>
<td>
<p>The node from which all paths will be determined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>to</code></td>
<td>
<p>The node to which all paths will be determined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>shortest_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>An option to return paths that are the shortest in the
set of all determined paths.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>longest_path</code></td>
<td>
<p>An option to return paths that are the longest in the set
of all determined paths.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integer values that specify which of the valid
paths to return when filtering by distance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of paths, sorted by ascending traversal length, comprising
vectors of node IDs in sequence of traversal through the graph.
</p>
