<h2>Detrended Cross-covariance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the detrended cross-covariance between two time series <code class="reqn">y1</code> and <code class="reqn">y2</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Fdcca(y1, y2, m = 3, nu = 0, overlap = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y1, y2</code></td>
<td>
<p>vectors corresponding to the time series data. If <code class="reqn">length(y1)</code> and <code class="reqn">length(y2)</code> differ, the longer time series is coerced to match the lenght of the shorter.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer or integer valued vector indicating the size (or sizes) of the window for the polinomial fit. <code class="reqn">min(m)</code> must be greater or equal than <code class="reqn">nu</code> or else it will return an error.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nu</code></td>
<td>
<p>a non-negative integer denoting the degree of the polinomial fit applied on the integrated series.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical: if true (the default), uses overlapping windows. Otherwise, non-overlapping boxes are applied.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of size <code class="reqn">length(m)</code> containing the detrended cross-covariance considering windows of size <code class="reqn">m+1</code>, for each <code class="reqn">m</code> supplied.
