<h2>Retrieve a specific modeling featurelist from a DataRobot project</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In time series projects, a new set of modeling features is created after setting the
partitioning options. These features are automatically derived from those in the project's
dataset and are the features used for modeling. Modeling features are only accessible once
the target and partitioning options have been set. In projects that don't use time series
modeling, once the target has been set, ModelingFeaturelists and Featurelists will behave
the same.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GetModelingFeaturelist(project, featurelistId)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>featurelistId</code></td>
<td>
<p>Unique alphanumeric identifier for the featurelist
to be retrieved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with the following elements describing the requested featurelist:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> featurelistId character. The unique alphanumeric identifier for the featurelist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> projectId character. The project to which the featurelist belongs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> features character. The names of the variables included in the featurelist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> name character. The name of the featurelist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> created character. A timestamp of when the featurelist was created.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> isUserCreated logical. Whether or not the featurelist was created by a user
(as opposed to DataRobot automation).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> numModels numeric. The number of models that currently use this featurelist.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
