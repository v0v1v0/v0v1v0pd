<h2>Options consulted by DataPackageR</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>User-configurable options consulted by DataPackageR, which
provide a mechanism for setting default behaviors for various functions.
</p>
<p>If the built-in defaults don't suit you, set one or more of these options.
Typically, this is done in the <code>.Rprofile</code> startup file, which you can open
for editing with <code>usethis::edit_r_profile()</code> - this will set the specified
options for all future R sessions. The following setting is recommended to
not be prompted upon each package build for a NEWS update:
</p>
<p><code>options(DataPackageR_interact = FALSE)</code>
</p>


<h3>Options for the DataPackageR package</h3>

<p>- <code>DataPackageR_interact</code>: Upon package load, this defaults to the value of
<code>interactive()</code>, unless the option has been previously set (e.g., in
<code>.Rprofile</code>). TRUE prompts user interactively for a NEWS update on
<code>package_build()</code>. See the example above and the
<a href="https://ropensci.org/blog/2018/09/18/datapackager/">rOpenSci blog
post</a> for more details on how to set this to FALSE, which will never prompt
user for a NEWS update. FALSE is also the setting used for DataPackageR
internal package tests.
</p>
<p>- <code>DataPackageR_verbose</code>: Default upon package load is TRUE. FALSE suppresses
all console output and is currently only used for automated
unit tests of the DataPackageR package.
</p>
<p>- <code>DataPackageR_packagebuilding</code>: Default upon package load is FALSE. This
option is used internally for package operations and changing it is not
recommended.
