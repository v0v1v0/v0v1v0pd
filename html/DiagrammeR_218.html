<h2>Select nodes based on a walk distance from a specified node</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Select those nodes in the neighborhood of nodes connected a specified
distance from an initial node.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">select_nodes_in_neighborhood(graph, node, distance, set_op = "union")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>A graph object of class <code>dgr_graph</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The node from which the traversal will originate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>distance</code></td>
<td>
<p>The maximum number of steps from the <code>node</code> for inclusion in
the selection.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>set_op</code></td>
<td>
<p>The set operation to perform upon consecutive selections of
graph nodes. This can either be as a <code>union</code> (the default), as an
intersection of selections with <code>intersect</code>, or, as a <code>difference</code> on the
previous selection, if it exists.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A graph object of class <code>dgr_graph</code>.
