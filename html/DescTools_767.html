<h2>Variance Inflation Factors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates variance-inflation and generalized variance-inflation factors
for linear and generalized linear models. It's a measure describing how much the variance of an estimated coefficient is increased because of collinearity.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">VIF(mod)

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mod</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object that responds to <code>coef</code>, <code>vcov</code>, and
<code>model.matrix</code>, such as an <code>lm</code> or <code>glm</code> object.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If all terms in an unweighted linear model have 1 df, then the usual variance-inflation
factors are calculated.
</p>
<p>The vif are defined as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">vif_j=\frac{1}{1-R_j^2}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">R_j^2</code> equals the coefficient of determination for regressing the explanatory variable <code>j</code> in question on the other terms in the model. This is one of the well-known collinearity diagnostics.
</p>
<p>If any terms in an unweighted linear model have more than 1 df, then generalized variance-inflation factors
(Fox and Monette, 1992) are calculated. These are interpretable as the inflation
in size of the confidence ellipse or ellipsoid for the coefficients of the term in
comparison with what would be obtained for orthogonal data.
</p>
<p>The generalized vifs
are invariant with respect to the coding of the terms in the model (as long as
the subspace of the columns of the model matrix pertaining to each term is
invariant). To adjust for the dimension of the confidence ellipsoid, the function
also prints <code class="reqn">GVIF^{1/(2\times df)}</code> where <code class="reqn">df</code> is the degrees of freedom
associated with the term.
</p>
<p>Through a further generalization, the implementation here is applicable as well to other sorts of models,
in particular weighted linear models and  generalized linear models.
</p>
<p>Values of vif up to 5 are usually interpreted as uncritical, values above 5 denote a considerable multicollinearity.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of vifs, or a matrix containing one row for each term in the model, and
columns for the GVIF, df, and <code class="reqn">GVIF^{1/(2\times df)}</code>.
