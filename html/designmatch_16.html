<h2>Optimal profile matching</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function for optimal profile matching to construct matched samples that are balanced toward a user-specified covariate profile.  This covariate profile can represent a specific population or a target individual, facilitating the generalization and personalization of causal inferences (Cohn and Zubizarreta 2022).  For each treatment group reservoir, <code>profmatch</code> finds the largest sample that is balanced relative to the profile.  The formulation of <code>profmatch</code> has been simplified to handle larger data than <code>bmatch</code> or <code>nmatch</code>.  Similar to <code>bmatch</code> or <code>nmatch</code>, the performance of <code>profmatch</code> is greatly enhanced by using the <code>solver</code> options <code>cplex</code> or <code>gurobi</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">	profmatch(t_ind, mom, solver = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t_ind</code></td>
<td>
<p>treatment indicator: a vector indicating treatment group of each observation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mom</code></td>
<td>
<p>moment balance parameters: a list with three arguments, 
</p>
<p><code>mom = list(targets = mom_targets, covs = mom_covs, tols = mom_tols)</code>.
</p>
<p><code>mom_targets</code> is the profile, i.e. a vector of target moments (e.g., means) of a distribution or a vector of characteristics of an individual toward which to balance the treatment groups. <code>mom_covs</code> is a matrix where each column is a covariate whose mean is to be balanced toward <code>mom_targets</code>.  <code>mom_tols</code> is a vector of tolerances for the maximum difference in means between the covariates in <code>mom_covs</code> and the elements of <code>mom_targets</code>.  <code>profmatch</code> will select units from each treatment group so that each matched group differs at most by <code>mom_tols</code> from the respective elements of <code>mom_targets</code>.  As a result, the matched groups will differ at most <code>mom_tols * 2</code> from each other.  Under certain assumptions, <code>mom_targets</code> can be used for constructing a representative matched sample.  The lengths of <code>mom_tols</code> and <code>mom_target</code> have to be equal to the number of columns of <code>mom_covs</code>.  Note that the columns of <code>mom_covs</code> can be transformations of the original covariates to balance higher order single-dimensional moments like variances and skewness, and multidimensional moments such as correlations (Zubizarreta 2012).</p>

<p>Optimization solver parameters: a list with four objects, 
</p>
<p><code>solver = list(name = name, t_max = t_max, approximate = 1, round_cplex = 0,</code><br><code>    trace_cplex = 0)</code>.
</p>
<p><code>solver</code> is a string that determines the optimization solver to be used.  The options are: <code>cplex</code>, <code>glpk</code>, <code>gurobi</code>, <code>highs</code>, and <code>symphony</code>.  The default solver is <code>highs</code> with <code>approximate = 1</code>. For an exact solution, we strongly recommend using <code>cplex</code> or <code>gurobi</code> as they are much faster than the other solvers, but they do require a license (free for academics, but not for people outside universities).  Between <code>cplex</code> and <code>gurobi</code>, note that installing the R interface for <code>gurobi</code> is much simpler.
</p>
<p><code>t_max</code> is a scalar with the maximum time limit for finding the matches.  This option is specific to <code>cplex</code>, <code>gurobi</code>, and <code>highs</code>.  If the optimal matches are not found within this time limit, a partial, suboptimal solution is given.  
</p>
<p><code>approximate</code> is a scalar that determines the method of solution.  If <code>approximate = 1</code> (the default), an approximate solution is found via a relaxation of the original integer program.  This method of solution is faster than <code>approximate = 0</code>, but some balancing constraints may be violated to some extent.  This option works only with <code>n_controls = 1</code>, i.e. pair matching.
</p>
<p><code>round_cplex</code> is binary specific to <code>cplex</code>.  <code>round_cplex = 1</code> ensures that the solution found is integral by rounding and all the constraints are exactly statisfied; <code>round_cplex = 0</code> (the default) encodes there is no rounding which may return slightly infeasible integer solutions.  
</p>
<p><code>trace</code> is a binary specific to <code>cplex</code> and <code>gurobi</code>. <code>trace = 1</code> turns the optimizer output on. The default is <code>trace = 0</code>.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">	
### Load, sort, and attach data
#data(lalonde)
#lalonde = lalonde[order(lalonde$treatment, decreasing = TRUE), ]
#attach(lalonde)

### Specify covariates
#covs = c("age", "education", "black", "hispanic", "married", "nodegree", "re74", "re75")

### Vector of treatment group indicators
#t_ind = lalonde$treatment

### Covariate matrix
#mom_covs = as.matrix(lalonde[, covs])

### Tolerances will be 0.05 * each covariate's standard deviation
#mom_sds = apply(lalonde[, covs], 2, sd)
#mom_tols = 0.05 * mom_sds

### Target moments will be the overall means in the sample
#mom_targets = colMeans(lalonde[, covs])

### Solver options
#t_max = 60*30
#solver = "gurobi"
#approximate = 0
#solver = list(name = solver, t_max = t_max, approximate = approximate, round_cplex = 0, trace = 0)

#mom = list(covs = mom_covs, tols = mom_tols, targets = mom_targets)
#pmatch_out = profmatch(t_ind, mom, solver)

### Selecting the matched units
#lalonde.matched = lalonde[pmatch_out$id,]

### Comparing TASMDs before and after matching
#TASMD.0.2 = abs(colMeans(lalonde.matched[which(lalonde.matched$treatment == 0), covs]) 
#                    - mom_targets) / mom_sds

#TASMD.0.1 = abs(colMeans(lalonde[which(lalonde$treatment == 0), covs]) - mom_targets) / mom_sds
#TASMD.1.1 = abs(colMeans(lalonde[which(lalonde$treatment == 1), covs]) - mom_targets) / mom_sds

### For each treatment group, ASAMDs are reduced after matching (i.e., balance is achieved)
#cbind(TASMD.0.1, TASMD.0.2)
#cbind(TASMD.1.1, TASMD.1.2)
