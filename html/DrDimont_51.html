<h2>Execute all DrDimont pipeline steps sequentially</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This wrapper function executes all necessary steps to generate differential integrated
drug response scores from the formatted input data. The following input data is required
(and detailed below):
</p>
<p>* Layers of stratified molecular data.
</p>
<p>* Additional connections between the layers.
</p>
<p>* Interactions between drugs and nodes in the network.
</p>
<p>* Settings for pipeline execution.
</p>
<p>As this function runs through all steps of the DrDimont pipeline it can take a long time to complete,
especially if the supplied molecular data is rather large. Several prompts will be printed to supply
information on how the pipeline is proceeding. Calculation of the interaction score by
<code>generate_interaction_score_graphs</code> requires saving large-scale graphs to file and calling
a Python script. This handover may take time.
</p>
<p>Eventually a data frame is returned containing the supplied drug name and its associated
differential drug response score computed by DrDimont.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">run_pipeline(
  layers,
  inter_layer_connections,
  drug_target_interactions,
  settings
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>layers</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] Named list with different network layers containing data and identifiers for
both groups. The required input format is a list with names corresponding to the content of
the respective layer (e.g., "protein"). Each named element has to contain the molecular data
and corresponding identifiers formatted by <code>make_layer</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inter_layer_connections</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A list with specified inter-layer connections. This list
contains one or more elements defining individual inter-layer connections created by
<code>make_connection</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drug_target_interactions</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A list specifying drug-target interactions for drug response
score computation. The required input format of this list is created by
<code>make_drug_target</code>. The drug response score is calculated for all drugs contained
in this object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>settings</code></td>
<td>
<p>[list] A named list containing pipeline settings. The settings list has to be
initialized by <code>drdimont_settings</code>. Items in the named list can be
adjusted as desired.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data frame containing drug name and associated differential integrated drug response score.
If Python is not installed or the interaction score computation fails for some other reason, NULL
is returned instead.
