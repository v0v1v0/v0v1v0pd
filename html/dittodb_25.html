<h2>Driver-specific mock classes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Each of the drivers that are supported have their own mock connection class.
They all inherit from <code>DBIMockConnection</code> as well as their own driver's
connection class. Each is only really available if the corresponding package
is installed.
