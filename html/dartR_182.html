<h2>OutFLANK:  An Fst outlier approach by Mike Whitlock and Katie Lotterhos,
University of British Columbia.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is the original implementation of Outflank by Whitlock and
Lotterhos. dartR simply provides a convenient wrapper around their functions
and an easier install being an r package (for information please refer to
their github repository)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">utils.outflank(
  FstDataFrame,
  LeftTrimFraction = 0.05,
  RightTrimFraction = 0.05,
  Hmin = 0.1,
  NumberOfSamples,
  qthreshold = 0.05
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FstDataFrame</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that includes a row for each locus, with
columns as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> $LocusName: a character string that uniquely names
each locus.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $FST: Fst calculated for this locus. (Kept here to
report the unbased Fst of the results)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $T1: The numerator of the estimator for Fst
(necessary, with $T2, to calculate mean Fst)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $T2: The denominator of the estimator of Fst
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $FSTNoCorr: Fst calculated for this locus without
sample size correction. (Used to find outliers)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $T1NoCorr: The numerator of the estimator for Fst
without sample size correction (necessary, with $T2, to
calculate mean Fst)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $T2NoCorr: The denominator of the estimator of Fst
without sample size correction
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $He: The heterozygosity of the locus (used to screen
out low heterozygosity loci that have a different distribution)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method looks for Fst outliers from a list of Fst's for different loci.
It assumes that each locus has been genotyped in all populations with
approximately equal coverage.
</p>
<p>OutFLANK estimates the distribution of Fst based on a trimmed sample of Fst's.
It assumes that the majority of loci in the center of the distribution are
neutral and infers the shape of the distribution of neutral Fst using a
trimmed set of loci. Loci with the highest and lowest Fst's are trimmed from
the data set before this inference, and the distribution of Fst df/(mean Fst)
is assumed to'follow a chi-square distribution. Based on this inferred
distribution, each locus is given a q-value based on its quantile in the
inferred null'distribution.
</p>
<p>The main procedure is called OutFLANK â€“ see comments in that function
immediately below for input and output formats. The other functions here are
necessary and must be uploaded, but are not necessarily needed by the user
directly.
</p>
<p>Steps:
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list with seven elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> FSTbar: the mean FST inferred from loci not marked as outliers
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> FSTNoCorrbar: the mean FST (not corrected for sample size -gives an
upwardly biased estimate of FST)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> dfInferred: the inferred number of degrees of freedom for the
chi-square distribution of neutral FST
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> numberLowFstOutliers: Number of loci flagged as having a significantly
low FST (not reliable)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> numberHighFstOutliers: Number of loci identified as having
significantly high FST
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> results: a data frame with a row for each locus. This data frame
includes all the original columns in the
data set, and six new ones:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> $indexOrder (the original order of the input data set),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $GoodH (Boolean variable which is TRUE if the expected
heterozygosity is greater than the Hemin set by input),
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $OutlierFlag (TRUE if the method identifies the locus as
an outlier, FALSE otherwise), and
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $q (the q-value for the test of neutrality for the locus)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $pvalues (the p-value for the test of neutrality for the
locus)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> $pvaluesRightTail the one-sided (right tail) p-value for
a locus
</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
