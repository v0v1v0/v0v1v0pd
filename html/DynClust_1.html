<h2>Denoising and clustering for dynamical image sequence (2D or 3D)+T</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>DynClust is a two-stage procedure for the denoising and
clustering of stack of noisy images acquired over time.
Clustering only assumes that the data contain an unknown
but small number of dynamic features. The method first
denoises the signals using local spatial and full temporal
information. The clustering step uses the previous output
to aggregate voxels based on the knowledge of their spatial
neighborhood. Both steps use a single keytool based on the
statistical comparison of the difference of two signals
with the null signal. No assumption is therefore required
on the shape of the signals. The data are assumed to be
normally distributed (or at least follow a symmetric
distribution) with a known constant variance. Working
pixelwise, the method can be time-consuming depending on
the size of the data-array but harnesses the power of
multicore cpus.
