<h2> Function for augmenting a design with D-optimal additional points using optFederov from package AlgDesign </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function for comfortably augmenting a design with D-optimal additional points;
this functionality is still somewhat experimental.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Dopt.augment(design, m=1, formula=NULL, candidates=NULL, constraint=NULL, 
    center=FALSE, nRepeats=5, 
    seed=NULL, randomize=TRUE, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>an experimental design of class <code>design</code>, 
which may not be a blocked, split-plot, neither 
crossed or parameter design; it also must not be replicated with repeat.only replications. 
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer number of additional points to add to design <code>design</code> </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p> a model formula (starting with a tilde), for the estimation of which a D-optimal design is sought;<br>
it can contain all column names from <code>data</code> 
or elements or element names from <code>factor.names</code>, respectively;<br>
usage of the “.”-notation for “all variables” from <code>data</code> or <code>factor.names</code> 
is possible. <br>
The default formula (if the value <code>NULL</code> is not changed) is the formula associated with 
the design (by function <code>formula.design</code>). 
</p>
<p>For quantitative factors, functions <code>quad()</code> and <code>cubic</code> describe the 
full quadratic or full cubic model in the listed variables (cf. examples 
and the <code>expand.formula</code>-function from package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>).  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>candidates</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame of candidate points; if not specified, candidates 
are constructed as a full factorial from the 
<code>factor.names</code> element of the <code>design.info</code> attribute of <code>design</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>constraint</code></td>
<td>
<p> a condition (character string!) used for reducing the candidate 
set to admissible points only. <br><code>constraint</code> is evaluated on the specified data set or after automatic creation 
of a full factorial candidate data set.<br> 
The variable names from <code>data</code> or <code>factor.names</code> can be used by the constraint.<br>
Per default (i.e. if the constraint is <code>NULL</code>), the constraint attribute from 
<code>design</code> is used. <br>
If a previously-applied constraint is to be removed, specify <code>constraint = ""</code>.<br>
It is not possible to apply a constraint that is already violated by the 
design that is to be augmented.
</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>center</code></td>
<td>
<p> requests that optimization is run for the centered model; 
the design is nevertheless output in non-centered coordinates
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nRepeats</code></td>
<td>
<p> number of independent repeats of the design optimization process; 
increasing this number may improve the chance of finding a global optimum, 
but will also increase search time
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>seed</code></td>
<td>
<p> seed for generation and randomization of the design (integer number);<br> 
here, the seed is needed even if the design is not randomized, because the 
generation process for the optimum design involves random numbers, even if the 
order of the final design is not randomized;<br>
if a reproducible design is needed, it is therefore recommended to specify a seed<br><br> 
In R version 3.6.0 and later, the default behavior of function <code>sample</code>
has changed. If you work in a new (i.e., &gt;= 3.6.-0) R version and want to reproduce 
a randomized design from an earlier R version (before 3.6.0), 
you have to change the RNGkind setting by<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="Rounding")</code><br>
before running function <code>Dopt.augment</code>.<br>
It is recommended to change the setting back to the new recommended way afterwards:<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="default")</code><br>
For an example, see the documentation of the example data set <code>VSGFS</code>.

<td><code>randomize</code></td>

<p> logical deciding whether or not the design should be randomized; 
if it is <code>TRUE</code>, the design (or the additional portion of the design) returned by the 
workhorse function <code>optFederov</code> is brought 
into random order after generation. Note that the generation process 
itself contains a random element per default; if exact repeatability for the 
returned design is desired, it is necessary to specify a seed (option <code>seed</code>) 
if in the case <code>randomize=FALSE</code>. </p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function <code>Dopt.augment</code> augments an existing design by <code>m</code> D-optimal 
additional points (unblocked designs, no split-plot, no parameter or crossed design, 
no repeat.only replications), i.e. by points that make the design particularly efficient 
for the intended model. 
</p>
<p>Option <code>center</code>, which is available for both blocked and unblocked designs as part of the ... argument, 
requests optimization for the centered model; the design that is created is nevertheless an uncentered design.
</p>
<p>NULL entries in the arguments are filled with automatic values that are determined 
from <code>design</code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a data frame of S3 class <code>design</code> 
with attributes attached. 
The data frame contains the experimental settings.
The matrix <code>desnum</code> attached as attribute <code>desnum</code> contains the 
model matrix of the design, using the formula as specified in the call. <br>
Function <code>Dopt.augment</code> preserves additional variables (e.g. responses) that 
have been added to the design <code>design</code> before augmenting. Note, however, that 
the response data are NOT used in deciding about which points to augment the design with.
</p>
<p>The attribute <code>run.order</code> provides the run number in standard order (as returned from 
function <code>optFederov</code> in package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>) as well 
as the randomized actual run order. The third column is always identical to the first. 
Note that the first n runs (the ones that are already present before augmentation) 
have run numbers in standard order from 1 to n (i.e. their original run numbers 
in standard order, if they were also generated by <code>Dopt.design</code> are lost).
</p>
<p>The attribute <code>design.info</code> is a list of various design properties, with type resolving to “Dopt.augment”. 
In addition to the standard list elements (cf. <code>design</code>), the element 
<code>quantitative</code> is a vector of <code>nfactor</code> logical values or NAs, 
and the optional <code>digits</code> elements indicates the number of digits to 
which the data were rounded. 
The list contains further entries regarding the optimality that has been achieved 
(<code>D</code>, <code>Dea</code> and <code>A</code>). 
</p>
<p>Note that the original design is contained in the first rows of the new data set. 
The original design also contains columns that are not directly part of the 
design, e.g. comment columns. <br>
Note that <code>replications</code> is always set to 1, even if the original design was 
replicated, and <code>repeat.only</code> is always FALSE. 
These elements are only present to fulfill the formal requirements for class <code>design</code>.)
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> This package is still under (slow) development. Reports about bugs and inconveniences are welcome.</p>
