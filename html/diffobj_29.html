<h2>Diff two character vectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Implementation of Myer's Diff algorithm with linear space refinement
originally implemented by Mike B. Allen as part of
<a href="http://www.ioplex.com/~miallen/libmba/">libmba</a>
version 0.9.1.  This implementation is a heavily modified version of the
original C code and is not compatible with the <code>libmba</code> library.
The C code is simplified by using fixed size arrays instead of variable
ones for tracking the longest reaching paths and for recording the shortest
edit scripts.  Additionally all error handling and memory allocation calls
have been moved to the internal R functions designed to handle those things.
A failover result is provided in the case where max diffs allowed is
exceeded.  Ability to provide custom comparison functions is removed.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">diff_myers(a, b, max.diffs = -1L, warn = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>a</code></td>
<td>
<p>character</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>b</code></td>
<td>
<p>character</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.diffs</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer(1L) how many differences before giving up; set to
-1 to allow as many as there are up to the maximum allowed (~INT_MAX/4).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>warn</code></td>
<td>
<p>TRUE or FALSE, whether to warn if we hit 'max.diffs'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The result format indicates operations required to convert <code>a</code> into
<code>b</code> in a precursor format to the GNU diff shortest edit script.  The
operations are “Match” (do nothing), “Insert” (insert one or
more values of <code>b</code> into <code>a</code>), and “Delete” (remove one or
more values from <code>a</code>).  The <code>length</code> slot dictates how
many values to advance along, insert into, or delete from <code>a</code>.  The
<code>offset</code> slot changes meaning depending on the operation.  For
“Match” and “Delete”, it is the starting index of that
operation in <code>a</code>.  For “Insert”, it is the starting index in
<code>b</code> of the values to insert into <code>a</code>; the index in <code>a</code> to
insert at is implicit in previous operations.
