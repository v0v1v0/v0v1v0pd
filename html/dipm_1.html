<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function creates a classification tree to identify
subgroups relevant to the precision medicine setting.
At each node of the classification tree, a random forest
of so-called embedded trees are fit and used to
calculate a depth variable importance score for each
candidate split variable in the data. The candidate
split variable with the largest variable importance score
is identified as the best split variable of the node.
Then, all possible splits of the selected split variable
are considered, and the split with the greatest split
criteria value is finally selected as the best split of
the best variable.
</p>
<p>The depth variable importance score was originally
proposed by Chen et al. (2007), and the score has been
adapted to the precision medicine setting here.
The depth variable importance score is a relatively
simple measure that takes into account two components:
the depth of a split in a tree and the strength of the
split. The strength of the split is captured with a G
test statistic that may be modified depending on the
type of analysis at hand. When the outcome variable is
continuous, G is the test statistic that tests the
significance of the split by treatment interaction term
in a linear regression model. When the outcome variable
is a right-censored survival time, G is the test statistic
that tests the significance of the split by interaction
term in a Cox proportional hazards model.
</p>
<p>When using <code>dipm</code>, note the following
requirements for the supplied data. First, the dataset
must contain an outcome variable Y and a treatment
variable. If Y is a right-censored survival time
outcome, then there must also be a status indicator
delta, where values of 1 denote the occurrence of the 
(harmful) event of interest, and values of 0 denote
censoring. If there are only two treatment groups, then
the two possible values must be 0 or 1. If there are
more than two treatment groups, then the possible values
must be integers starting from 1 to the total number of
treatment assignments. In regard to the candidate split
variables, if a variable is binary, then the variable
must take values of 0 or 1. If a variable is nominal,
then the values must be integers starting from 1 to the
total number of categories. There cannot be any missing
values in the dataset. For candidate split variables
with missing values, the missings together (MT) method
proposed by Zhang et al. (1996) is helpful.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>dipm</code> returns the final classification tree as a 
<code>party</code> object by default or a data frame. See
Hothorn and Zeileis (2015) for details. The data 
frame contains the following columns of information:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>node</code></td>
<td>
<p>Unique integer values that identify each node
in the tree, where all of the nodes are
indexed starting from 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the candidate split
variable used to split each node, where
all of the variables are indexed starting
from 1; for terminal nodes, i.e., nodes
without child nodes, the value is set 
equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitvar_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the candidate split 
variables used to split each node
obtained from the column names of the
supplied data; for terminal nodes,
the value is set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Characters that denote the type of each 
candidate split variable; "bin" is for binary
variables, "ord" for ordinal, and "nom" for
nominal; for terminal nodes, the value is set
equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitval</code></td>
<td>
<p>Values of the left child node of the 
current split/node; for binary variables,
a value of 0 is printed, and subjects with
values of 0 for the current <code>splitvar</code>
are in the left child node, while subjects
with values of 1 are in the right child
node; for ordinal variables,
<code>splitval</code> is numeric and implies
that subjects with values of the current
<code>splitvar</code> less than or equal to
<code>splitval</code> are in the left child 
node, while the remaining subjects with 
values greater than <code>splitval</code> are in 
the right child node; for nominal
variables, the <code>splitval</code> is a set of
integers separated by commas, and subjects
in that set of categories are in the left
child node, while the remaining subjects
are in the right child node; for terminal
nodes, the value is set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lchild</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the index (i.e.,
<code>node</code> value) of each node's left
child node; for terminal nodes, the value is
set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rchild</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the index (i.e.,
<code>node</code> value) of each node's right
child node; for terminal nodes, the value is
set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that specify the depth of each
node; the root node has depth 1, its 
children have depth 2, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsubj</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that count the total number of
subjects within each node</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>besttrt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that denote the identified best 
treatment assignment of each node</p>
</td>
</tr>
