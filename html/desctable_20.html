<h2>Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs Fisher's exact test for testing the null of independence
of rows and columns in a contingency table with fixed marginals, or with a formula expression.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fisher.test(
  x,
  y,
  workspace,
  hybrid,
  control,
  or,
  alternative,
  conf.int,
  conf.level,
  simulate.p.value,
  B
)

## Default S3 method:
fisher.test(x, ...)

## S3 method for class 'formula'
fisher.test(
  x,
  y = NULL,
  workspace = 200000,
  hybrid = F,
  control = list(),
  or = 1,
  alternative = "two.sided",
  conf.int = T,
  conf.level = 0.95,
  simulate.p.value = F,
  B = 2000
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>either a two-dimensional contingency table in matrix form, a factor object, or a formula of the form <code>lhs ~ rhs</code> where <code>lhs</code> and <code>rhs</code> are factors.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>a factor object; ignored if <code>x</code> is a matrix or a formula.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>workspace</code></td>
<td>
<p>an integer specifying the size of the workspace
used in the network algorithm.  In units of 4 bytes.  Only used for
non-simulated p-values larger than <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> tables.
Since <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span> version 3.5.0, this also increases the internal stack size
which allows larger problems to be solved, however sometimes needing
hours.  In such cases, <code>simulate.p.values=TRUE</code> may be more
reasonable.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hybrid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a logical. Only used for larger than <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code>
tables, in which cases it indicates whether the exact probabilities
(default) or a hybrid approximation thereof should be computed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with named components for low level algorithm
control.  At present the only one used is <code>"mult"</code>, a positive
integer <code class="reqn">\ge 2</code> with default 30 used only for larger than
<code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> tables.  This says how many times as much
space should be allocated to paths as to keys: see file
‘<span class="file">fexact.c</span>’ in the sources of this package.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>or</code></td>
<td>
<p>the hypothesized odds ratio.  Only used in the
<code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alternative</code></td>
<td>
<p>indicates the alternative hypothesis and must be
one of <code>"two.sided"</code>, <code>"greater"</code> or <code>"less"</code>.
You can specify just the initial letter.  Only used in the
<code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conf.int</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating if a confidence interval for the
odds ratio in a <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> table should be
computed (and returned).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conf.level</code></td>
<td>
<p>confidence level for the returned confidence
interval.  Only used in the <code class="reqn">2 \times 2</code> case and if

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>x</code> is a matrix, it is taken as a two-dimensional contingency
table, and hence its entries should be nonnegative integers.
Otherwise, both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> must be vectors of the same length.
Incomplete cases are removed, the vectors are coerced into factor
objects, and the contingency table is computed from these.
</p>
<p>For 2 by 2 cases, p-values are obtained directly using the
(central or non-central) hypergeometric distribution. Otherwise,
computations are based on a C version of the FORTRAN subroutine
FEXACT which implements the network developed by Mehta and Patel
(1986) and improved by Clarkson, Fan and Joe (1993).  The FORTRAN
code can be obtained from <a href="http://www.netlib.org/toms/643">http://www.netlib.org/toms/643</a>.
Note this fails (with an error message) when the entries of the
table are too large.  (It transposes the table if necessary so it
has no more rows than columns.  One constraint is that the product
of the row marginals be less than 2^31 - 1.)
</p>
<p>For 2 by 2 tables, the null of conditional independence is
equivalent to the hypothesis that the odds ratio equals one.
<code>Exact</code> inference can be based on observing that in general, given
all marginal totals fixed, the first element of the contingency
table has a non-central hypergeometric distribution with
non-centrality parameter given by the odds ratio (Fisher, 1935).
The alternative for a one-sided test is based on the odds ratio,
so <code>alternative = "greater"</code> is a test of the odds ratio being
bigger than <code>or</code>.
</p>
<p>Two-sided tests are based on the probabilities of the tables, and
take as <code>more extreme</code> all tables with probabilities less than or
equal to that of the observed table, the p-value being the sum of
such probabilities.
</p>
<p>For larger than 2 by 2 tables and <code>hybrid = TRUE</code>, asymptotic
chi-squared probabilities are only used if the ‘Cochran
conditions’ are satisfied, that is if no cell has count zero, and
more than 80
exact calculation is used.
</p>
<p>Simulation is done conditional on the row and column marginals,
and works only if the marginals are strictly positive.  (A C
translation of the algorithm of Patefield (1981) is used.)
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with class <code>"htest"</code> containing the following components:
</p>
<p>p.value: the p-value of the test.
</p>
<p>conf.int: a confidence interval for the odds ratio.  Only present in
the 2 by 2 case and if argument <code>conf.int = TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>estimate: an estimate of the odds ratio.  Note that the _conditional_
Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) rather than the
unconditional MLE (the sample odds ratio) is used.  Only
present in the 2 by 2 case.
</p>
<p>null.value: the odds ratio under the null, <code>or</code>.  Only present in the 2
by 2 case.
</p>
<p>alternative: a character string describing the alternative hypothesis.
</p>
<p>method: the character string <code>"Fisher's Exact Test for Count Data"</code>.
</p>
<p>data.name: a character string giving the names of the data.
