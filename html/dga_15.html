<h2>Transforms Records to List Intersection Counts by Stratum</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Helps you to create list overlaps in the correct order to be used in bma.cr.
This function also does some of the heavy lifting to stratify records by
time (date, etc.) and other variables.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">make.strata(
  overlaps,
  dates = NULL,
  locations = NULL,
  demographics = NULL,
  date.defs = "monthly",
  loc.defs = NULL,
  demog.defs = NULL,
  start.date = NULL,
  end.date = NULL
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlaps</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame that tells whether the i'th record appears on
the j'th lists, where n is the total number of sampled elements and p is the
number of lists. For example, if the [3,2] entry is 1, then the third
element appeared on the second list. If it is zero, then the third element
did NOT appear on the second list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dates</code></td>
<td>
<p>record dates, in identical row oder to overlaps. This must be a
chron object. Do not include this if you don't want to stratify by time.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>locations</code></td>
<td>
<p>record locations, though unlike the dates, there is nothing
special about the type that would prevent you from using any other variable
type to stratify by here. Do not include this unless you want to stratify by
the factor you include here.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>demographics</code></td>
<td>
<p>record demographic variables. Like locations, there is
nothing specific to this that requires this be demographic. This should be a
factor. Do not incude this unless you want to stratify by this factor.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>date.defs</code></td>
<td>
<p>how you'd like to stratify by date. This defaults to
"monthly". Other options are "weekly", "daily", and "yearly". If you enter
an integer (k) instead of one of these options, the data will be stratified
into blocks of size k days.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>loc.defs</code></td>
<td>
<p>How to divide up all of the levels of locations into groups.
e.g. if locations has levels A, B, and C, and you'd like to stratify so that
A and B are one strata and C is another, input loc.defs = list(g1 = c('A',
'B'), g2 = c('C')). If this is left as NULL, each level will be put into its
own stratum.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>demog.defs</code></td>
<td>
<p>Similar to loc.defs. Same format. Including both just
allows you to stratify along two dimensions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>start.date</code></td>
<td>
<p>A chron object of one date.  This gives the date of
earliest record we want to include. If NULL, this defaults to the earliest
record in the dataset.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>end.date</code></td>
<td>
<p>a chron object of one date. This gives the date of the
latest record to be included. If NULL, this defaults to the latest record in
the dataset. This can only be included if dates are given.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap.counts</code></td>
<td>
<p> a data frame where each row gives the list
intersection counts that can be used in bma.cr</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>source.counts</code></td>
<td>
<p> a data
frame that gives the total number of records by each data source and
stratum. </p>
</td>
</tr>
