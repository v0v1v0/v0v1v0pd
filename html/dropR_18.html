<h2>Start the dropR Shiny App</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Starts the interactive web application to use dropR in your web browser.
Make sure to use Google Chrome or Firefox for best experience.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The app will give less experienced R users or statisticians a good overview of
how to conduct dropout analysis. For more experienced analysts, it can still be very helpful
in guiding how to use the package as there are some steps that should be taken in order,
which is outlined in the app (as well as function documentation).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>No return value; starts the shiny app as a helper to get started with dropout analysis. All app procedures are available as functions.
