<h2>Simulate a design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Runs many simulations of a design and returns a simulations data.frame. Speed gains can be achieved by running simulate_design in parallel, see Examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">simulate_design(
  ...,
  sims = 500,
  future.seed = requireNamespace("future", quietly = TRUE)
)

simulate_designs(
  ...,
  sims = 500,
  future.seed = requireNamespace("future", quietly = TRUE)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>A design created using the + operator, or a set of designs. You can also provide a single list of designs, for example one created by <code>expand_design</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sims</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of simulations, defaulting to 500. If sims is a vector of the form c(10, 1, 2, 1) then different steps of a design will be simulated different numbers of times.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>future.seed</code></td>
<td>
<p>Option for parallel diagnosis via the function future_lapply. A logical or an integer (of length one or seven), or a list of length(X) with pre-generated random seeds. By default, this is set to TRUE if the <code>future</code> and <code>future.apply</code> packages are installed, and FALSE if not. For details, see ?future_lapply.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Different steps of a design may each be simulated different a number of times, as specified by sims. In this case simulations are grouped into "fans". The nested 
structure of simulations is recorded in the dataset using a set of variables named "step_x_draw." For example if sims = c(2,1,1,3) is passed to simulate_design, then there
will be two distinct draws of step 1, indicated in variable "step_1_draw" (with values 1 and 2) and there will be three draws for step 4 within each of the step 1 draws, recorded in "step_4_draw" (with values 1 to 6).

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Two-arm randomized experiment

    N = 500,
    gender = rbinom(N, 1, 0.5),
