<h2>Extracting information about zero-claims and severity inflation
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A way of extracting information about zero-claims and severity development inflation through the DCL method applied to two counts triangles: number of payments and number of reported claims. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">extract.prior(Xtriangle, Npaid, Ntriangle, Plots = TRUE , n.cal = NA ,
  Fj.X = NA , Fj.N = NA , Fj.Npaid = NA )
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Xtriangle</code></td>
<td>

<p>The paid run-off triangle: incremental aggregated payments. It should be a matrix with incremental aggregated  payments located in the upper triangle and the lower triangle  consisting in missing or zero values.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Npaid</code></td>
<td>

<p>A run-off (incremental) triangle with the number of payments. It should be a matrix with the observed counts located in the upper triangle and the lower triangle  consisting in missing or zero values. It should has the same dimension as <code>Xtriangle</code> (both in the same aggregation level (quarters, years,etc.))
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Ntriangle </code></td>
<td>

<p>The counts data triangle: incremental number of reported claims. It should be a matrix with the observed counts located in the upper triangle and the lower triangle  consisting in missing or zero values. It should has the same dimension as <code>Xtriangle</code> (both in the same aggregation level (quarters, years,etc.))
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Plots</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If TRUE (default) it is showed a two by one plot showing the extracted severity inflation in the development direction and the probability of zero-claims for each underwriting period.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n.cal</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer specifying the number of most recent calendars which will be used to calculate the development factors. By default <code>n.cal=NA</code> and all the observed calendars    are used (classical chain ladder). </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Fj.X</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional vector with lentgth m-1 (m being the dimension of the triangles) with the development factors to calculate the chain ladder estimates from <code>Xtriangle</code>. See more details in <code>clm</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Fj.Npaid</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional vector with lentgth m-1 with the development factors to calculate the chain ladder estimates from <code>Npaid</code>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Fj.N</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional vector with lentgth m-1 with the development factors to calculate the chain ladder estimates from <code>Ntriangle</code>. </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function implements the strategy proposed in the paper by Martinez-Miranda, Nielsen, Verrall and Wuthrich (2013) to extract information for additional triangles (see "Section 5: An example showing how other data can be used to provide prior information in practice"). The derived severity inflation <code>inflat.j</code> does not extend to the tail. If you want provide the tail, by using <code>dcl.predict.prior</code>, the vector  should be extended to have dimension 2m-1, otherwise the tail will be not provided (as was done in the cited paper).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inflat.j </code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector with dimension m with the extracted severity inflation in the development direction.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Qi </code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector with dimension m with the extracted probability of zero-claims for undewriting period.</p>
</td>
</tr>
