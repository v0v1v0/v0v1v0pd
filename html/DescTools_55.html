<h2>Confidence Interval for a Difference of Binomials

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several confidence intervals for the difference between proportions are available, but they can produce markedly different results. Traditional approaches, such as the Wald interval do not perform well unless the sample size is large. Better intervals are available. These include the Agresti/Caffo method (2000), Newcombe Score method (1998) and more computing intensive ones as by Miettinen and Nurminen (1985) or Mee (1984). The latter ones are favoured by Newcombe (when forced to choose between a rock and a hard place).

</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">BinomDiffCI(x1, n1, x2, n2, conf.level = 0.95, sides = c("two.sided","left","right"),
            method = c("ac", "wald", "waldcc", "score", "scorecc", "mn",
                       "mee", "blj", "ha", "hal", "jp"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<p> confidence level, defaults to 0.95. </p>
</td>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sides</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string specifying the side of the confidence interval, must be one of <code>"two.sided"</code> (default),
<code>"left"</code> or <code>"right"</code>. You can specify just the initial letter. <code>"left"</code> would be analogue to a hypothesis of
<code>"greater"</code> in a <code>t.test</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p> one of <code>"wald"</code>, <code>"waldcc"</code>, <code>"ac"</code>, <code>"score"</code>, <code>"scorecc"</code>, <code>"mn"</code>, <code>"mee"</code>, <code>"blj"</code>, <code>"ha"</code>, <code>"hal"</code>, <code>"jp"</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All arguments are being recycled.
</p>
<p>We estimate the difference between proportions using the sample proportions:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\hat{\delta} =\hat{p}_1 - \hat{p}_2 = \frac{x_1}{n_1} - \frac{x_2}{n_2}</code>
</p>

<p>The traditional <b>Wald </b> confidence interval for the difference of two proportions <code class="reqn">\delta</code> is based on the asymptotic normal distribution of <code class="reqn">\hat{\delta}</code>.
</p>
<p>The <b>Corrected Wald</b> interval uses a continuity correction included in the test statistic. The continuity correction is subtracted from the numerator of the test statistic if the numerator is greater than zero; otherwise, the continuity correction is added to the numerator. The value of the continuity correction is (1/n1 + 1/n2)/2.
</p>
<p>The <b>Agresti-Caffo</b> (code <code>"ac"</code>) is equal to the Wald interval with the adjustment according to Agresti, Caffo (2000) for difference in proportions and independent samples. It adds 1 to x1 and x2 and adds 2 to n1 and n2 and performs surpringly well.
</p>
<p><b>Newcombe</b> (code <code>"scorecc"</code>) proposed a confidence interval for the difference based on the Wilson score confidence interval for a single proportion. A variant uses a continuity correction for the Wilson interval (code <code>"scorecc"</code>).
</p>
<p><b>Miettinen and Nurminen</b> showed that the restricted maximum likelihood estimates for p1 and p2 can
be obtained by solving a cubic equation and gave unique closed-form expressions for them. The Miettinen-Nurminen confidence interval is returned with code <code>"mn"</code>.
</p>
<p>The <b>Mee</b> (code <code>"mee"</code>) interval proposed by Mee (1984) and Farrington-Manning (1990) is using the same maximum likelihood estimators as Miettinen-Nurminen but with another correcting factor.
</p>
<p>The <b>Brown, Li's Jeffreys</b> (code <code>"blj"</code>) interval was proposed by Brown, Li's Jeffreys (2005).
</p>
<p>The <b>Hauck-Anderson</b> (code <code>"ha"</code>) interval was proposed by Hauck-Anderson (1986).
</p>
<p>The <b>Haldane</b> (code <code>"hal"</code>) interval is described in Newcombe (1998) and so is
the <b>Jeffreys-Perks</b> (code <code>"jp"</code>).
</p>
<p>Some approaches for the confidence intervals can potentially yield negative results or values beyond [-1, 1]. These would be reset such as not to exceed the range of [-1, 1].
</p>
<p>Which of the methods to use is currently still the subject of lively discussion and has not yet been conclusively clarified. See e.g. Fagerland (2011).
</p>
<p>The general consensus is that the most widely taught method <code>method="wald"</code> is inappropriate in many situations and should not be used. Recommendations seem to converge around the Miettinen-Nurminen based methods (<code>method="mn"</code>).
