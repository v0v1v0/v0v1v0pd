<h2>
distillery: Methods to Distill Information from R Objects
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">distillery</span> contains primarily method functions to distill out pertinent information from R objects, as well as to compute confidence intervals.  It now also contains new fairly general bootstrap functions.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Primary functions include:
</p>
<p><code>distill</code>: Typically, to distill pertinent information from a complicated (usually a list) object and return a named vector.
</p>
<p><code>ci</code>: Calculate confidence intervals.  This is a method function for calculating confidence intervals.  Includes methods for numeric vectors and matrices, whereby the mean is taken (column-wise for matrices) and normal approximation confidence intervals for the mean are calculated and returned.
</p>
<p><code>booter</code>, <code>pbooter</code> and <code>tibber</code>: Functions to perform bootstrap resampling that work with <code>ci</code> (<code>booter</code> and <code>pbooter</code>).  Allows for m &lt; n bootstrap resampling, circular block bootstrapping, parametric bootstrap resampling (<code>pbooter</code>), and the test-inversion bootstrap approach (<code>tibber</code>).
