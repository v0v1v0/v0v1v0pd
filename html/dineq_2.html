<h2>Regression-based decomposition of inequality</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Decomposition of (income) inequality into multiple characteristics. A
regression-based decomposition method is used.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dineq_rb(formula, weights = NULL, data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class "formula" (or one that can be coerced to that class):
a symbolic description of the model to be fitted in the ordinary least squares regression.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>an optional vector of weights to be used in the fitting process. Should be
NULL or a numeric vector. Should be inside selected data frame in the function and between
quotation marks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame containing the variables in the model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function uses a multivariate regression-based decomposition method. Multiple
variables can be added to the function in order to calculate the contribution of each
individual variable (including the residual) to the inequality. For instance socio-economic,
demographic and geographic characteristics (such as age, household composition, gender, region,
education) of the household or the individual can be added.
</p>
<p>This decomposition can be used on a broad range of inequality measure, like Gini, Theil,
mean log deviation, Atkinson index and variance of log income.
</p>
<p>It uses a logarithmic transformation of the values of the dependent variable. Therefore it
cannot handle negative or zero values. Those are excluded from the computation in this function.
</p>
<p>The main difference with the decomposition of the mean log deviation or Gini coefficient is that
multiple characteristics can be analyzed at the same time. While the other decomposition functions
only analyze one characteristic at the same time.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list with the results of the decomposition, containing the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>inequality_measures</code></td>
<td>
<p>the values of 4 inequality measures: gini, mean log deviation,
theil and variance of log income</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>decomposition_inequality</code></td>
<td>
<p>the (relative) decomposition of the inequality into the
different variables</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>regression_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>results of the ols regression which is used to make the
decomposition of inequality</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>note</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of zero or negative observations. The function uses a logarithmic
transformation of x as input for the regression. Therefore these observations are deleted
from the analysis</p>
</td>
</tr>
