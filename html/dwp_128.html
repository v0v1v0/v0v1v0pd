<h2>Import Carcass Observations Locations from Shape Files</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Carcass coordiates (x, y) and turbine IDs are read using <code>st_read</code> 
and formatted for adding to <code>rings</code> data structures for analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">readCarcass(file_cod, unitCol = "turbine", quiet = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file_cod</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of the file with carcass observation data. Currently, the
function requires a shape file, which gives the carcass locations on the same
coordinate system that is used for the turbines. The geometry is a simple
features points file, consisting of at least the three mandatory files standard
components (.shp, .shx, .dbf) stored in the same directory. Only the name of the
.shp is required (for example, <code>file_cod = "carcasses.shp"</code>). Other
components are automatically searched for and processed if available.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>unitCol</code></td>
<td>
<p>name of column with turbine IDs. Column name and turbine IDs
must match those of the <code>data_layout</code> and <code>file_turbine</code> used in
the call to <code>initLayout</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>quiet</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean for directing the function to print calculation progress
updates and messages to the console. This should be set to <code>FALSE</code> unless
you know clearly why you want to turn off the messaging.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a <code>shapeCarcass</code> object, which is a list with <code>$carcasses</code>,
which is a <code>sf</code> representation of the shape file <code>file_cod</code> data;
<code>$unitCol</code>, which is the name of the unit column; and <code>$ncarc</code>, which
is a vector of carcass counts at the turbines listed in <code>unitCol</code>. The
elements of the <code>$ncarc</code> are named by turbines at which they were found.
