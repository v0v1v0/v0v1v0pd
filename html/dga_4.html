<h2>Checks Each Stratum for Suitability for Capture-Recapture</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes in list intersection counts and source list totals as produced by
make.strata. It then checks whether there are between three and five lists,
whether all of the lists are non-empty, and whether all of the lists overlap
with some other list.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">check.strata(strata)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>strata</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of list overlaps and source countsin the format of the
output of make.strata. list.overlaps contains a data frame of list overlaps
by stratum. source.counts contains the number of records by source and
stratum.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A boolean indicating whether any serious problems have been found
with the strata.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This does not issue a warning for cases where some subset of lists is
not connected to the others, e.g. Lists A and B have overlap with each
other, lists C and D have overlap with each other, but no records from A or
B overlap with lists C or D. We suggest that you examine the list
intersection counts manually as well.
