<h2>Gompertz function yield prediction for perennials</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Yields of trees or other perennial plants have to be simulated in order to
predict the outcomes of many interventions. Unlike annual crops, however,
trees normally yield nothing for a few years after planting, following which
yields gradually increase until they reach a tree-specific maximum. This is
simulated with this function, which assumes that a Gompertz function is a
good way to describe this (based on the general shape of the curve, not on
extensive research...). The function assumes that yields remain at the
maximum level, once this is reached. For long simulations, this may not be a
valid assumption!
The function parameters are estimated based on yield estimates for two
points in time, which the user can specify. They are described by a year
number and by a percentage of the maximum yield that is attained at that
time.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gompertz_yield(
  max_harvest,
  time_to_first_yield_estimate,
  time_to_second_yield_estimate,
  first_yield_estimate_percent,
  second_yield_estimate_percent,
  n_years,
  var_CV = 0,
  no_yield_before_first_estimate = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_harvest</code></td>
<td>
<p>maximum harvest from the tree (in number of fruits, kg or
other units)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_to_first_yield_estimate</code></td>
<td>
<p>year (or other time unit) number, for
which the first yield estimate is provided by first_yield_estimate_percent</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time_to_second_yield_estimate</code></td>
<td>
<p>year (or other time unit) number, for
which the second yield estimate is provided by second_yield_estimate_percent</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>first_yield_estimate_percent</code></td>
<td>
<p>percentage of the maximum yield that is
attained in the year (or other time unit) given by
time_to_first_yield_estimate</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>second_yield_estimate_percent</code></td>
<td>
<p>percentage of the maximum yield that is
attained in the year (or other time unit) given by
time_to_second_yield_estimate</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_years</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of years to run the simulation</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>var_CV</code></td>
<td>
<p>coefficient indicating how much variation should be introduced
into the time series of n_targeted_per_year, annual_adoption_rate,
perc_disadopt and spontaneous adoption. If this is one numeric value, then
this value is used for all variables. If var_CV is a numeric vector with 4
elements, each of these is used to introduce variation in one of these
variables (in the sequence: n_targeted_per_year, annual_adoption_rate,
perc_disadopt and spontaneous adoption). The numbers correspond to the
coefficient of variation that the resulting time series should have. The
default is 0, for a time series with no artificially introduced variation.
See description of the vv function for more details on this.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>no_yield_before_first_estimate</code></td>
<td>
<p>boolean variable indicating whether
yields before the time unit indicated by time_to_first_yield_estimate should
be 0</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>vector of n_years numeric values, describing the simulated yield of
the perennial. This starts at 0 and, if the simulation runs for a sufficient
number of years, approaches max_harvest. If var_CV&gt;0, this time series
includes artificial variation.
