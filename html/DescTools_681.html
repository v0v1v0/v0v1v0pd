<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The standardized coefficients are meant to allow for a comparison of the importance of explanatory
variables that have different variances. Each of them shows the effect on the response of increasing
its predictor X(j) by one standard deviation, as a multiple of the response's standard deviation.
This is often a more meaningful comparison of the relevance of the input variables.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that increasing one X(j) without also changing others may not be possible in a
given application, and therefore, interpretation of coefficients can always be tricky. Furthermore,
for binary input variables, increasing the variable by one standard deviation is impossible, since an
increase can only occur from 0 to 1, and therefore, the standardized coeffient is somewhat counterintuitive in this case.
</p>
<p>Standardizing model coefficients has the same effect as centring and
scaling the input variables.
</p>
<p>“Classical” standardized coefficients
are calculated as
<code class="reqn">\betaᵢ* = \betaᵢ (sₓᵢ / Sᵧ)
        </code>
, where
<code class="reqn">\beta</code> is the unstandardized coefficient,
<code class="reqn">sₓᵢ</code>
is the
standard deviation of associated depenent variable
<code class="reqn">Xᵢ</code>  and
<code class="reqn">Sᵧ</code>
is <abbr><span class="acronym">SD</span></abbr> of the response variable.
</p>
<p>If the variables are intercorrelated, the standard deviation of
<code class="reqn">Xᵢ</code>
used in computing the standardized coefficients
<code class="reqn">\betaᵢ*</code> should be
replaced by a partial standard deviation of
<code class="reqn">Xᵢ</code> which is adjusted for
the multiple correlation of
<code class="reqn">Xᵢ</code>  with the other <code class="reqn">X</code> variables
included in the regression equation. The partial standard deviation is
calculated as
<code class="reqn">s*ₓᵢ = sₓᵢ √(VIFₓᵢ⁻¹) √((n-1)/(n-p))
        </code>,
where VIF is the variance inflation factor,
n is the number of observations and p number of predictors in
the model. Coefficient is then transformed as
<code class="reqn">\betaᵢ* = \betaᵢ s*ₓᵢ
        </code>.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with at least two columns for standardized coefficient estimate and
its standard error. Optionally, third column holds degrees of freedom
associated with the coefficients.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Fit model to original data:
fm  &lt;- lm(Fertility ~ Agriculture + Examination + Education + Catholic,
          data = swiss)

# Partial SD for the default formula:
psd &lt;- PartialSD(lm(data = swiss))[-1] # remove first element for intercept

# Standardize data:
zswiss &lt;- scale(swiss, scale = c(NA, psd), center = TRUE)
# Note: first element of 'scale' is set to NA to ignore the first column 'y'

# Coefficients of a model fitted to standardized data:
# zapsmall(coefTable(stdizeFit(fm, data = zGPA)))
# Standardized coefficients of a model fitted to original data:
# zapsmall(StdCoef(fm, partial = TRUE))


# Standardizing nonlinear models:
fam &lt;- Gamma("inverse")
fmg &lt;- glm(log(Fertility) ~ Agriculture + Examination + Education + Catholic,
           data = swiss, family = fam)

psdg &lt;- PartialSD(fmg)
# zGPA &lt;- stdize(GPA, scale = c(NA, psdg[-1]), center = FALSE)
# fmgz &lt;- glm(log(y) ~ z.x1 + z.x2 + z.x3 + z.x4, zGPA, family = fam)

# Coefficients using standardized data:
# coef(fmgz) # (intercept is unchanged because the variables haven't been
           #  centred)
# Standardized coefficients:
# coef(fmg) * psdg
