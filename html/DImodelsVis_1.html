<h2>DImodelsVis: Model interpretation and visualisation for compositional data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Statistical models fit to compositional data are often difficult to
interpret due to the sum to one constraint on data variables. <code>DImodelsVis</code>
provides novel visualisations tools to aid with the interpretation for models
where the predictor space is compositional in nature. All visualisations in the
package are created using the <code>ggplot2</code>
plotting framework and can be extended like every other <code>ggplot</code> object.
</p>

<h4><strong>Introduction to Diversity-Interactions (DI) models:</strong></h4>

<p>While sometimes it is of interest to model a compositional data response,
there are times when the predictors of a response are compositional, rather
than the response itself. Diversity-Interactions (DI) models
(Kirwan et al., 2009; Connolly et al., 2013; Moral et al., 2023;) are a
regression based modelling technique for analysing and interpreting data from
biodiversity experiments that explore the effects of species diversity on the
different outputs (called ecosystem functions) produced by an ecosystem.
Traditional techniques for analysing diversity experiments quantify species
diversity in terms of species richness (i.e., the number of species present
in a community). The DI method builds on top of this <code>richness</code> approach by
taking the relative abundances of the species within in the community into
account, thus the predictors in the model are <code>compositional</code> in nature. The
<code>DI</code> approach can differentiate among different species identities as well as
between communities with same set of species but with different relative
proportions, thereby enabling us to better capture the relationship between
diversity and ecosystem functions within an ecosystem.
The <code>DImodels</code> and
<code>DImodelsMulti</code> R packages are
available to aid the user in fitting these models. The <code>DImodelsVis</code>
(DI models Visualisation) package is a complimentary package for visualising and
interpreting the results from these models. However, the package is versatile and
can be used with any standard statistical model object in R where the predictor
space is compositional in nature.

<h4><strong>Package Map:</strong></h4>

<p><img src="../help/figures/DImodelsVisWorkflowPackage.png" style="width:750px;max-width:75%;" alt="DImodelsVisWorkflowPackage.png"></p>
<p>The functions in the package can be categorised as functions for visualising
model selection and validation or functions to aid with model interpretation.
Here is a list of important visualisation functions present in the package
along with a short description.
</p>
<p><strong>Model selection and validation</strong> <br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>model_diagnostics</code></strong>: Create diagnostics plots for a
statistical model with the additional ability to overlay the points
with <code>pie-glyphs</code> showing
the proportions of the compositional predictor variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>model_selection</code></strong>: Show a visual comparison of
selection criteria for different models. Can also show the split of
an information criteria into deviance and penalty components to
visualise why a parsimonious model would be preferable over a complex one.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Model interpretation</strong> <br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>prediction_contributions</code></strong>: The predicted response
for observations is visualised as a stacked bar-chart showing the
contributions of each term in the regression model.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>gradient_change</code></strong>: The predicted response for specific
observations are shown using <code>pie-glyphs</code>
along with the average change in the predicted response over the richness or
evenness diversity gradients.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>conditional_ternary</code></strong>: Assuming we have <code>n</code>
compositional variables, fix <code>n-3</code> compositional variables to have
specific values and visualise the change in the predicted response across
the remaining three variables as a contour plot in a ternary diagram.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>visualise_effects</code></strong>: Visualise the effect of increasing
or decreasing a predictor variable (from a set of compositional predictor
variables) on the predicted response whilst keeping the ratio of the other
<code>n-1</code> compositional predictor variables constant.

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>simplex_path</code></strong>: Visualise the change in the predicted
response along a straight line between two points in the simplex space.

</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All functions aiding with model interpretation have a corresponding <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠*_data⁠</code> function
to prepare the underlying data and a <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠*_plot⁠</code> function which accepts this data and
creates the plot. Such a split between the data-preparation and plotting functions
results in a lot of flexibility for the user. This also enables the users to create
these visualisations with any statistical model object in R.
</p>
<p><strong>Other utility functions</strong> <br></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><code>add_prediction</code></strong>: A utility function to add prediction
and associated uncertainty to data using a statistical model object or raw model
coefficients.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>get_equi_comms</code></strong>: Utility function to create all possible
combinations of equi-proportional communities at a given level of richness from a set
of <code>n</code> compositional variables.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>custom_filter</code></strong>: A handy wrapper around the dplyr
<code>filter()</code> function enabling the user to filter rows
which satisfy specific conditions for compositional data like all equi-proportional
communities, or communities with a given value of richness without having to
make any changes to the data or adding any additional columns.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>prop_to_tern_proj</code></strong> and <strong><code>tern_to_prop_proj</code></strong>:
Helper functions for converting between 3-d compositional data and their 2-d projection.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><code>ternary_data</code></strong> and <strong><code>ternary_plot</code></strong>:
Visualise the change in the predicted response across a set of three compositional
predictor variables as a contour map within a ternary diagram.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Load libraries
library(DImodels)
library(DImodelsVis)

## Load data
data(sim2)
sim2 &lt;- sim2[sim2$block == 1, ]

## Fit model with compositional data
mod &lt;- DI(y = "response", prop = 3:6,
          DImodel = "AV", data = sim2)

## Model diagnostics plots but points are replaced by
## pie-glyphs showing the proportions of the compositional variables
## See `?model_diagnostics` for more information

model_diagnostics(model = mod, which = c(1, 2))


## Visualise the predicted response variable as contributions
## (predictor coefficient * predictor value) from the individual
## terms in the model
## See `?prediction_contributions` for more information
prediction_contributions(model = mod)

## Visualise the change in average response over a diversity gradient
## This plot shows the change in the response over a diversity gradient
## We use richness (number of non-zero variables in a given observation)
## as our gradient in this example. The black line shows the average response
## at each level of richness while the position of the pie-glyphs show variations
## about this average whilst also showing the relative abundances of each
## variable in the composition.
## See `?gradient_change` for more information
plot_data &lt;- get_equi_comms(nvars = 4, variables = c("p1", "p2", "p3", "p4"))
gradient_change(model = mod, data = plot_data)

## Visualise effects of increasing or decreasing a variable
## within a set of compositional variables
## This plot shows the effect of increasing the proportion of p1
## in several different initial compositions of the variables
## p1, p2, p3, and p4. Each curve shows the effect of increasing
## the proportion of p1 whilst keeping the relative proportions of
## the other three variables unchanged
## See `?visualise_effects` for more information
visualise_effects(model = mod,
                  data = sim2[1:11, ],
                  var_interest = "p1")

## Visualise the change in the predicted response along a straight line
## between two points in the simplex space.
## We visualise the change in the response as we from the centroid mixture to
## each of the monocultures
## See `?simplex_path` for more information
simplex_path(model = mod,
             starts = sim2[5,],
             ends = sim2[12:15,])

## Visualise slices of the n-dimensional simplex as ternary diagrams.
## 2-d slices of the n-dimensional simplex are created by conditioning
## certain compositional variables at a specific values `p` while the
## remaining variables are allowed to vary within the range `0` to `1-p`.
## In this example variable p1 is conditioned to have values `0`, `0.2`, and `0.5`
## One ternary diagram is created for each case where p2, p3, and p4 are
## allowed to vary from `0` upto `1`, `0.8`, and `0.5`, respectively.
## This is equivalent to taking multiple slices of the n-dimensional simplex
## and viewing multiple slices would enable us to get a picture the change
## in the response across the n-dimensional simplex.
## For example the response is maximised where p1 is 0.2
## See `?conditional_ternary` for more information

conditional_ternary(model = mod, tern_vars = c("p2", "p3", "p4"),
