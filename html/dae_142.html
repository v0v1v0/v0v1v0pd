<h2>Data for an experiment to investigate the effects of grazing patterns on
pasture composition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The response variable is the percentage area covered by the principal grass 
(Main.Grass). The design for the experiment is a split-unit design. The main units 
are arranged in 3 Rows x 3 Columns. Each main unit is split into 
2 SubRows x 2 SubColumns.
</p>
<p>The factor Period, with levels 3, 9 and 18 days, is assigned to the main units 
using a 3 x 3 Latin square. The two-level factors Spring and Summer are 
assigned to split-units using a criss-cross design within each main unit. 
The levels of each of Spring and Summer are two different grazing patterns in its season.
