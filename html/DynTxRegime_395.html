<h2>Create Model Objects for Subsets of Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Extends the buildModelObj() function of package <span class="pkg">modelObj</span>. Here,
the returned model object includes a specification of the 
decision point and subset of the data to which the model is to 
be applied.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">buildModelObjSubset(
  ...,
  model,
  solver.method,
  solver.args = NULL,
  predict.method = NULL,
  predict.args = NULL,
  dp = 1L,
  subset = NA
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>ignored. Included to require named input.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>model</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>formula</code>. The symbolic description
of the model to be fitted. If the regression method specified in
solver.method accepts as input a <code>formula</code> object,
model is passed to the solver.method function. If the regression method
instead accepts a matrix of covariates as the model to fit, <code>model</code> is
used to obtain the model matrix that is passed to the solver.method
function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>solver.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code>. The name of 
the R function to be used to obtain parameter estimates, e.g., 'lm', 
'glm', or 'rpart'. The specified function MUST have a 
corresponding predict method, which can be the generic predict() function.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>solver.args</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>list</code>. Additional arguments 
to be sent to the function specified in solver.method. This 
argument must be provided as a named list, where the name of each element 
matches a formal argument of the function specified in 
solver.method. For example, if a logistic regression using 
'glm' is desired, 
</p>
<pre>
solver.method = "glm"
solver.args = list("family"=binomial)
</pre>
<p>See Details section for further information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predict.method</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code>. The name of 
the R function to be used to obtain  predictions, e.g., 'predict.lm', 
'predict', or 'predict.glm'.  If no function is explicitly 
given, the generic <code>predict()</code> is assumed. For many regression 
methods, the generic <code>predict()</code> method is appropriate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>predict.args</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>list</code>. Additional arguments 
to be sent to the function specified in predict.method. This 
argument must be provided as a named list, where the name of each 
element matches a formal argument of the function specified in 
predict.method. For example, if a logistic regression using 
'glm' was used to fit the model and predictions on the scale of the 
response are desired, 
</p>
<pre>
predict.method = "predict.glm"
predict.args = list("type"="response").
</pre>
<p>See Details section for further information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dp</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>integer</code>. The decision point for which 
this model and subset are defined.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>character</code>. A nickname for the 
subset for which model and methods are to be used. This argument will 
be used by the methods of <span class="pkg">DynTxRegime</span> to "link" input arguments. 
In the event that a model is to be fit using more than 1 subset, 
collapse the subset names into a single character string separating 
each with a comma. For example, if the model is to be fit using patients 
in both subsets "a" and "b," the subset nickname should be "a,b" (no space).</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In some settings, an analyst may want to use different models for unique 
subsets of the data. <code>buildModelObjSubset()</code> provides a mechanism for 
users to define models for such subset. Specifically, models are specified 
in connection with the decision point and subset to which they are to be 
applied. 
</p>
<p>See ?modelObj for further details
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>ModelObjSubset</code>, which contains a  
complete description of the conditions under which a model  is to be  
used and the R methods to be used to obtain parameter estimates and  
predictions.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Consider a 2 decision point trial. At the 1st decision point, the subset of 
# treatment options available to each patient is always set "set1."
# At the 2nd decision point, some patients are eligible to receive
# treatment from set "set2a" and others from set "set2b." The outcome
# for these subsets will be modeled as ~ x1 + x2 and ~ x2 + x3, respectively.
#
# All parameter estimates are to be obtained used lm and predictions obtained using predict.
#
# The following illustrates how to build these model objects.

  model &lt;- list()

  model[[1]] &lt;- buildModelObjSubset(dp = 1, subset = "set1",
                                    model = ~ x1 + x2 + x3, solver.method = 'lm')

  model[[2]] &lt;- buildModelObjSubset(dp = 2, subset = "set2a",
                                    model = ~ ~ x1 + x2, solver.method = 'lm')
