<p> the same as in function <code>FrF2</code>;<br>
is EITHER <br>

OR a vector or list of generators similar to <code>generators</code>. <br>
In the latter case,

<li>
<p> that one single number is always interpreted as the number of blocks rather than a column reference, 
</p>
</li>
<li>

In R version 3.6.0 and later, the default behavior of function <code>sample</code>
has changed. If you work in a new (i.e., &gt;= 3.6.-0) R version and want to reproduce 
a randomized design from an earlier R version (before 3.6.0), 
you have to change the RNGkind setting by<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="Rounding")</code><br>
before running function <code>ccd.design</code>.<br>
It is recommended to change the setting back to the new recommended way afterwards:<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="default")</code><br>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The statistical background of central composite designs is briefly described 
under <code>CentralCompositeDesigns</code>.
</p>
<p>Function <code>ccd.design</code> creates a central composite design from scratch. 
It proceeds by generating a cube design with function <code>FrF2</code> and then 
augmenting this cube design using functions <code>add.center</code> from package 
<span class="pkg">FrF2</span> for adding center points to the cube and subsequently function 
<code>ccd</code> from package <span class="pkg">rsm</span> for generating the star portion of 
the design. 
</p>
<p>There are two main purposes for this function: one is to provide 
central composite designs within the same syntax philosophy 
used in packages <code>DoE.base-package</code> and <code>FrF2</code>. 
The other is to automatically identify good (=resolution V) cube portions, 
which can be achieved by using the resolution parameter.
</p>
<p>In comparison to direct usage of package <span class="pkg">ccd</span>, the functions make the syntax closer to 
that of the other packages in the DoE.wrapper suite and allow automatic selection of fractional 
factorials as cubes. 
</p>
<p>Function <code>ccd.design</code> does not allow direct use of the <code>estimable</code> functionality 
that is available in function <code>FrF2</code>. Nevertheless, ccd designs with a cube 
based on the <code>estimable</code> functionality can be generated 
by first using function <code>FrF2</code> and subsequently applying 
function <code>ccd.augment</code>. It may for example be interesting to use designs based on 
estimability requirements for 2-factor interactions in cases where a resolution V cube 
for the ccd is not feasible - of course, this does not allow to estimate the full second order model
and therefore generates a warning.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a data frame of S3 class <code>design</code> 
with attributes attached. The data frame itself is in the original data scale. 
The data frame <code>desnum</code> attached as attribute <code>desnum</code> is the coded design. 
The attribute <code>design.info</code> is a list of various design properties. 
The element <code>type</code> of that list is the character string <code>ccd</code>.
Besides the elements present in all class <code>design</code> objects, 
there are the elements quantitative (vector with <code>nfactor</code> TRUE entries),
and a <code>codings</code> element usable in the coding functions available in the <span class="pkg">rsm</span> 
package, e.g. <code>coded.data</code>.
</p>
<p>Note that the row names and the standard order column in the 
<code>run.order</code> attribute of ccd designs 
are not in conventional order, 
if the blocking routine <code>blockpick.big</code> was used. 
In such situations, these should not be used as the basis for any calculations. 
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a randomized design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> This package is still under (slow) development. Reports about bugs and inconveniences are welcome. <code>ccd.design</code> is based on version 1 of package <span class="pkg">rsm</span>. </p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ccd.design(5) ## per default uses the resolution V design in 16 runs for the cube
ccd.design(5, ncube=32) ## uses the full factorial for the cube
ccd.design(5, ncenter=6, default.levels=c(-10,10))
## blocked design (requires ncube to be specified)
ccd.design(5, ncube=32, blocks=4) 
## there is only one star point block

## for usage of other options, look at the FrF2 documentation
