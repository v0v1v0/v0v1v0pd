<h2>Simple Precision Medicine Tree</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function creates a classification tree
designed to identify subgroups in which subjects
perform especially well or especially poorly in a
given treatment group.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">spmtree(
  formula,
  data,
  types = NULL,
  nmin = 5,
  maxdepth = Inf,
  print = TRUE,
  dataframe = FALSE,
  prune = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A description of the model to be fit with format
<code>Y ~ treatment | X1 + X2</code> for data with a
continuous outcome variable Y and 
<code>Surv(Y, delta) ~ treatment | X1 + X2</code> for data with
a right-censored survival outcome variable Y and
a status indicator delta</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix or data frame of the data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>types</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector, data frame, or matrix of the types
of each variable in the data; if left blank, the
default is to assume all of the candidate split
variables are ordinal; otherwise, all variables in 
the data must be specified, and the possible variable 
types are: "response", "treatment", "status", "binary", 
"ordinal", and "nominal" for outcome variable Y, the 
treatment variable, the status indicator (if 
applicable), binary candidate split variables, ordinal
candidate split variables, and nominal candidate split
variables respectively</p>

<td><code>nmin</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer specifying the minimum node size of
the overall classification tree</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxdepth</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer specifying the maximum depth of the
overall classification tree; this argument is 
optional but useful for shortening computation 
time; if left blank, the default is to grow the 
full tree until the minimum node size <code>nmin</code> 
is reached</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>print</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean (TRUE/FALSE) value, where TRUE prints
a more readable version of the final tree to the
screen</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<td>
<p>A boolean (TRUE/FALSE) value, where TRUE returns
the final tree as a dataframe</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prune</code></td>
<td>
<p>A boolean (TRUE/FALSE) value, where TRUE prunes
the final tree using <code>pmprune</code> function</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To identify the best split at each node of the 
classification tree, all possible splits of all 
candidate split variables are considered. The single
split with the highest split criteria score is
identified as the best split of the node. For data with 
a continuous outcome variable, the split criteria is the 
DIFF value that was first proposed for usage in the 
relative-effectiveness based method (Zhang et al. (2010),
Tsai et al. (2016)). For data with a survival outcome 
variable, the split criteria is the squared test 
statistic that tests the significance of the split by 
treatment interaction term in a Cox proportional hazards 
model.
</p>
<p>When using <code>spmtree</code>, note the following
requirements for the supplied data. First, the dataset
must contain an outcome variable Y and a treatment
variable. If Y is a right-censored survival time
outcome, then there must also be a status indicator
delta, where values of 1 denote the occurrence of the 
(harmful) event of interest, and values of 0 denote
censoring. If there are only two treatment groups, then
the two possible values must be 0 or 1. If there are
more than two treatment groups, then the possible values
must be integers starting from 1 to the total number of
treatment assignments. In regard to the candidate split
variables, if a variable is binary, then the variable
must take values of 0 or 1. If a variable is nominal,
then the values must be integers starting from 1 to the
total number of categories. There cannot be any missing
values in the dataset. For candidate split variables
with missing values, the missings together (MT) method
proposed by Zhang et al. (1996) is helpful.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>spmtree</code> returns the final classification tree as a 
<code>party</code> object by default or a data frame. See 
Hothorn and Zeileis (2015) for details. The data 
frame contains the following columns of information:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>node</code></td>
<td>
<p>Unique integer values that identify each node
in the tree, where all of the nodes are
indexed starting from 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitvar</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the candidate split
variable used to split each node, where
all of the variables are indexed starting
from 1; for terminal nodes, i.e., nodes
without child nodes, the value is set 
equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitvar_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the candidate split 
variables used to split each node
obtained from the column names of the
supplied data; for terminal nodes,
the value is set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Characters that denote the type of each 
candidate split variable; "bin" is for binary
variables, "ord" for ordinal, and "nom" for
nominal; for terminal nodes, the value is set
equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>splitval</code></td>
<td>
<p>Values of the left child node of the 
current split/node; for binary variables,
a value of 0 is printed, and subjects with
values of 0 for the current <code>splitvar</code>
are in the left child node, while subjects
with values of 1 are in the right child
node; for ordinal variables,
<code>splitval</code> is numeric and implies
that subjects with values of the current
<code>splitvar</code> less than or equal to
<code>splitval</code> are in the left child 
node, while the remaining subjects with 
values greater than <code>splitval</code> are in 
the right child node; for nominal
variables, the <code>splitval</code> is a set of
integers separated by commas, and subjects
in that set of categories are in the left
child node, while the remaining subjects
are in the right child node; for terminal
nodes, the value is set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>lchild</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the index (i.e.,
<code>node</code> value) of each node's left
child node; for terminal nodes, the value is
set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rchild</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that represent the index (i.e.,
<code>node</code> value) of each node's right
child node; for terminal nodes, the value is
set equal to NA</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>depth</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that specify the depth of each
node; the root node has depth 1, its 
children have depth 2, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nsubj</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that count the total number of
subjects within each node</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>besttrt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integers that denote the identified best 
treatment assignment of each node</p>
</td>
</tr>
