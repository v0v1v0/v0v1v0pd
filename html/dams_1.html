<h2>Dams in the United States from the National Inventory of Dams (NID)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data from NID was downloaded from <a href="http://nid.usace.army.mil">http://nid.usace.army.mil</a>.
Subsequently, the raw data was checked for potential errors and cleaned.
The dams package provides a subset of NID fields and functionality (<code>get_nid()</code>) to access the entire NID dataset.
