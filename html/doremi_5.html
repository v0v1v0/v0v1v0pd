<h2>Calculation of derivatives using the GOLD method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>calculate.gold</code> estimates the derivatives of a variable using the Generalized Orthogonal Local Derivative (GOLD)
method described in doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/00273171.2010.498294">10.1080/00273171.2010.498294</a>Deboeck (2010). The code available on this paper was extracted and adapted for non constant time steps.
This method allows calculating over a number of measurement points (called the embedding number) derivatives with uncorrelated errors.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calculate.gold(signal, time, embedding = 3, n = 2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>signal</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector containing the data from which the derivative is estimated.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>time</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector containing the time values corresponding to the signal. Arguments signal and time must have the same length.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>embedding</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an integer indicating the number of points to consider for derivative calculation. Embedding must be greater than 1 because at least
two points are needed for the calculation of the first derivative and at least 3 for the calculation of the second derivative.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>is the maximum order of derivative to estimate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list containing the following elements:
</p>
<p>dtime- contains the time values in which the derivative was calculated. That is, the moving average of the input time over embedding points.
</p>
<p>dsignal- is a data.frame containing n+1 columns and the same number of rows as the signal.
The column k is the k-1 order derivative of the signal over embedding points.
</p>
<p>embedding- number of points used for the derivative calculation.
</p>
<p>n - the maximum derivative order calculated n
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#In the following example the derivatives for the function y(t) = t^2 are calculated.
#The expected results are:
#y'(t) = 2t and y''(t) = 2
time &lt;- c(1:500)/100
signal &lt;- time^2
result &lt;- calculate.gold(signal = signal, time = time, embedding = 5)
