<h2>Compare two rank orderings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function compares two rank orderings that have the same elements. 
For an order of length <em>n</em> 
there are <em>n choose 2</em> dyadic relationships implied by that order. 
For example, the order a, b, c implies that a &gt; b, a  &gt; c, and b &gt; c.
The dyadic similarity between two orders is the proportion of implied 
dyadic relationships that are shared by the two orders.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dyadic_similarity(order1, order2)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order1</code></td>
<td>
<p>The first rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
be supplied as an interaction matrix with identities as the dimension names.
All identities in order1 must be in order2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>order2</code></td>
<td>
<p>The second rank ordering to be compared. Alternatively, this can
be supplied as an interaction matrix with identities as the dimension names. 
All identities in order2 must be in order1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The proportion of dyadic relationships that are shared by the two orders.
This value is 1 if the orders are identical and 0 if the orders are
exact opposites.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dyadic_similarity(letters[1:20], letters[1:20]) #identical orders
dyadic_similarity(letters[1:20], letters[20:1]) #opposite orders
dyadic_similarity(sample(letters[1:20]), sample(letters[1:20])) #random orders

</code></pre>
