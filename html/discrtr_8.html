<h2>McMaster Commuting Data set (wide format).</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing information about <em>students</em> commuting to McMaster University. Data were collected
by means of a travel survey in the fall of 2010. Respondents were asked about their mode of
travel to McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. They were also asked about the modes available
to them. The characteristics of the trips were self-reported or imputed. The data set also contains
relevant attributes about the respondents. The format of the table is wide, with each individual
decision maker in a row.
