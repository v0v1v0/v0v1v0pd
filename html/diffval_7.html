with the initial partition of the relevés (i.e., a vector with values from
1 to <code>k</code>, with length equal to the number of columns of <code>m_bin</code>, ascribing
each relevé to one of the <code>k</code> groups). By default, <code>p_initial = "random"</code>,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a phytosociological table (<code>m_bin</code>, rows corresponding to
taxa and columns corresponding to relevés) this function searches for
a <code>k</code>-partition (<code>k</code> defined by the user) optimizing TDV, i.e., searches,
using a Hill-climbing algorithm, for patterns of differential taxa by
rearranging the relevés into <code>k</code> groups.
</p>
<p>Optimization can start from a random partition (<code>p_ini = "random"</code>), or
from a given partition (<code>p_ini</code>, defined by the user or produced by any
clustering method, or even a manual classification of the relevés).
</p>
<p>Each iteration searches for a TDV improvement screening all 1-neighbours,
until the given number of maximum iterations (<code>maxit</code>) is reached. A
1-neighbour of a given partition is another partition obtained by changing
1 relevé (of the original partition) to a different group. A n-neighbour
is obtained, equivalently, ascribing n relevés to different groups.
</p>
<p>Optionally, a faster search (Stochastic Hill-climbing) can be performed in
a first step (<code>stoch_first = TRUE</code>), consisting on searching for TDV
improvements, by randomly selecting, in each iteration, one n-neighbour (n
defined by the user in the parameter <code>stoch_neigh_size</code>), accepting that
n-neighbour partition as a better solution if it improves TDV. This is
repeated until a given number of maximum iterations (<code>stoch_maxit</code>) is
reached. Stochastic Hill-climbing might be helpful for big tables (where
the screening of all 1-neighbours might be too time consuming).
</p>
<p>Several runs of this function (i.e., multiple starts) should be
tried out, as several local maxima are usually present and the
Hill-climbing algorithm converges easily to local maxima.
</p>
<p>Trimming your table by a 'constancy' range or using the result of other
cluster methodologies as input, might help finding interesting partitions.
Specially after trimming the table by a 'constancy' range, getting a random
initial partition with TDV greater than zero might be unlikely; on such
cases using a initial partition from <code>partition_tdv_grasp()</code> or
<code>partition_tdv_grdtp()</code> (or even the result of other clustering
strategies) as an input partition might be useful.
</p>
