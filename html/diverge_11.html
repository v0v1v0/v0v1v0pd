<h3>Details</h3>

<p>OVERVIEW <br>
model_select estimates parameters and compares the fit of up to 20 evolutionary models to lineage-pair datasets based on likelihood, AIC, and AICc. It is the key function in this package for most users. We strongly recommend that users define the models they want to fit to the data (i.e. only those models that are relevant to distinguishing among hypotheses of interest) rather than simply fitting all models (the default option).
</p>
<p>In most cases, if you find that a model fails to fit (e.g. NaN is being returned for likelihood for one or more models), then the default starting parameters are not well-suited to your dataset and you will need to make a list of custom starting parameters (see 'starting' argument above).
</p>
<p>Note on troubleshooting: if models fail to converge or return nonsensical results, it is usually the case that the default starting parameter values are no good (i.e. the true parameter values are well outside the default values). Start your troubleshooting by creating custom starting parameter matrices for the different models (see 'starting' argument above).
</p>
<p>RUN TIME CONSIDERATIONS <br>
model_select calls the underlying function find_mle, which launches likelihood searches from a large set of starting parameter values to avoid getting stuck on local optima (see find_mle for more details). This set of starting parameter values grows rapidly with parameter number, so model comparisons that include the most complex evolutionary models (esp DA_wt, DA_wt_linear) can take several minutes. We recommend using the parallel=TRUE option where resources allow when including any model more complex than DA_null. Users can define their own starting parameter sets but should keep in mind this tradeoff between run time and the breadth of parameter space through which to search. 
</p>
<p>MODELS OF EVOLUTIONARY TRAIT DIVERGENCE <br>
Users can select up to twenty evolutionary models that differ in how a continuous trait in two lineages "i" and "j" evolves after their initial departure from a common ancestor at T=0. All models require div and age vectors, but some models require additional data. The models are:
</p>
<p>(1) BM_null
Description: The trait in both lineages evolves under Brownian Motion (BM) processes. 
Parameter: sig2 (i.e. sigma^2, the dispersion parameter of a BM process; this parameter the same in both lineages).
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined starting matrix must be a 1 column matrix containing sig2 starting values.
</p>
<p>(2) BM_linear 
Description: Same as BM_null but sig2 varies as a linear function of a continuous variable such as latitude, elevation, or body size. 
Additional Data Required: values of the continuous variable for each pair must be provided in the 'GRAD' vector. 
Parameters: sig2_slope (slope of sig2~gradient relationship), sig2_int (intercept of sig2~gradient relationship).
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined starting matrix must be 2 column matrix with col1 = sig2_slope and col2 = sig2_int.
</p>
<p>(3) BM_cat 
Description: similar to BM_null but sig2 varies among discrete categories to which different pairs belong, such as allopatric versus sympatric ranges, or different pollinator type.
Additional Data Required: The numeric category code of each pair must be provided in the 'cats' vector. A value must be provided for every pair (i.e. the cats vector must be as long as the data vectors). For example, in a 2-category dataset (e.g. a dataset containing allopatric and sympatric pairs), all pairs of one category can be assigned a 'cats' value of 0, and all pairs of the other category are assigned a 'cats' value of 1. If a third category existed, those pairs would be assigned a 'cats' value of 2, and so on with additional categories. 
Parameters = sig2_1, sig2_2, ... sig2_n, where n is the number of categories.
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be an n column matrix where col1 = sig2_1, col2 = sig2_2, ..., coln= sig2_n. 
</p>
<p>(4) OU_null

Parameters: alpha (the OU constraint parameter), sig2 - both parameters are shared by the two lineages
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be 2 column matrix in the order col1 = alpha and col2 = sig2.
</p>
<p>(5) OU_linear

</p>
<p>(7) OU_cat

Additional Data Required: The numeric category code of each pair must be provided in the 'cats' vector. A value must be provided for every pair (i.e. the cats vector must be as long as the data vectors). For example, in a 2-category dataset (e.g. a dataset containing allopatric and sympatric pairs), all pairs of one category can be assigned a 'cats' value of 0, and all pairs of the other category are assigned a 'cats' value of 1. If a third category existed, those pairs would be assigned a 'cats' value of 2, and so on with additional categories. 
Parameters = sig2, alpha_1, alpha_2, ... alpha_n, where n is the number of categories.
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be an n+1 column matrix where col1 = sig2, col2 = alpha_1, col3 = alpha_2, ..., col(n+1)= alpha_n. 
</p>
<p>(8) DA_null 
Description: Traits evolve under independent OU processes in lineages i and j after they depart from an ancestor, and these processes differ only in the value of their optima (see Anderson and Weir, 2020, 'Inferring speciation drivers from functional trait divergence'. Am Nat, 196, 429-442.).
Parameters: alpha, sig2, and psi (the distance between optima of independent OU processes).
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined starting matrix must be 3 column matrix where col1 = alpha, col2 = sig2, and col3 = psi.

</p>
<p>(15) OU_BM_linear

For example, in a 2-category dataset (e.g. a dataset containing allopatric and sympatric pairs), all pairs of one category can be assigned a 'cats' value of 0, and all pairs of the other category are assigned a 'cats' value of 1.

</p>
<p>(17) DA_wt
Description: Like DA_null but with a discrete shift in psi that occurs after a wait time shared by all pairs in the dataset. DA_wt estimates this wait time based on divergence levels of pairs of different ages, so datasets should contain many pairs from a broad range of ages. 
Parameters: alpha, sig2, psi1 (distance between optima prior to the wait time), psi2 (distance between optima after the wait time), and wt (the wait time to a shift in psi; the time after initial divergence from a common ancestor at which a shift occurs).
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be 5 column matrix where col1 = alpha, col2 = sig2, col3 = psi1, col4=psi2, and col5=wt.
</p>
<p>(18) DA_bp 
Description: Like DA_null but with a discrete shift in psi that occurs after some "breakpoint" time (bp) known to the user. Differs from DA_wt in two ways: (1) the timing of the discrete shift isn't isn't estimated as a parameter; it is instead provided by the user in the breakpoint vector that contains a bp value for each pair, and (2) the timing of the discrete shift is not shared by all pairs.
Additional Data Required: Values of bp for each pair must be provided in the breakpoint vector. 
Parameters: alpha, sig2, psi1, psi2
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be 4 column matrix where col1 = alpha, col2 = sig2, col3 = psi1, and col4=psi2
Additional Notes: This model is useful for testing hypotheses related to dated biogeographic events. For example, consider a set of lineage pairs with diverge times between 3 and 7my. If a river formed 1mya and isolated some of these already-diverging pairs on either side, we might hypothesize that this caused a shift in psi for those pairs, and a breakpoint model can test this. Bp is then calculated as bp = AgeOfPair - 1my for each pair divided by the river. For pairs that aren't divided by the river, we set bp = 0. 
IMPORTANT: datasets must contain pairs that HAVE and HAVE NOT experienced the hypothesized shift in psi. In the river example, the dataset must contain pairs whose lineages were NOT separated by the river. BP IS SET TO 0 FOR ALL SUCH PAIRS. Parameter estimation and model_selection is most accurate when ~60-75 percent of the dataset is comprised of bp=0 (aka "single-epoch") pairs. 
</p>
<p>(19) DA_wt_linear 
Description: Like DA_wt except psi varies with a continuous gradient both before and after the wait time. 
Additional Data Required: Values of the continuous variable for each pair must be provided in the 'GRAD' vector. 
Parameters: alpha, sig2, psi1_sl (slope of psi1~gradient relationship), psi1_int (intercept of psi1~gradient relationship), psi2_sl (slope of psi2~gradient relationship), psi2_int (intercept of psi2~gradient relationship), wt
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be 7 column matrix where col1 = alpha, col2 = sig2, col3 = psi1_slope, col4=psi1_int, col5=psi2_slope, col6=psi1_int, and col7=wt
</p>
<p>(20) DA_bp_linear 
Description: Like DA_bp except psi varies with a continuous gradient both before and after the wait time. 
Additional Data Required: Values of the continuous variable for each pair must be provided in the 'GRAD' vector AND values of bp for each pair must be provided in the breakpoint vector. 
Parameters: alpha, sig2, psi1_slope (distance between optima prior to bp), psi1_int, psi2_slope (slope of distance beteen optima after bp), psi2_int (intercept of distance between optima after bp)
Optional custom starting matrix: A user-defined p_starting matrix must be 6 column matrix where col1 = alpha, col2 = sig2, col3 = psi1_slope, col4=psi1_int, col5=psi2_slope, and col6=psi2_int
</p>
<p>In general, BM-models may be interpreted as representing random drift or fluctuating selection in trait evolution, OU-models may be interpreted as representing parallel adaptation or shared stabilizing selection (these are mathematically identical in this context), and DA-models may be interpreted as representing divergent adaptation (i.e. evolution in which lineages are generally pulled by selection toward alternative adaptive optima following initial divergence from a common ancestor)
