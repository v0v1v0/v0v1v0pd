<h2>Convert docx to pdf</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Convert docx to pdf directly using "Microsoft Word".
This function will not work if "Microsoft Word" is not available
on your machine.
</p>
<p>The calls to "Microsoft Word" are made differently depending on the
operating system:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> On "Windows", a "PowerShell" script using COM
technology is used to control "Microsoft Word". The resulting PDF
is containing a browsable TOC.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> On macOS, an "AppleScript" script is used to control "Microsoft Word".
The resulting PDF is not containing a browsable TOC as when on 'Windows'.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">docx2pdf(input, output = gsub("\\.(docx|doc|rtf)$", ".pdf", input))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>input, output</code></td>
<td>
<p>file input and optional file output (default
to input with pdf extension).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the name of the produced pdf (the same value as <code>output</code>)
</p>


<h3>Windows authorizations</h3>

<p>If your execution policy is set to "RemoteSigned", 'doconv' will
not be able to run powershell script. Set it to "Unrestricted" and it
should work. If you are in a managed and administrated environment,
you may not be able to use 'doconv' because of execution policies.
</p>


<h3>Macos manual authorizations</h3>

<p>On macOS the call is happening into a working
directory managed with function <code>working_directory()</code>.
</p>
<p>Manual interventions are necessary to authorize 'Word' and
'PowerPoint' applications to write in a single directory: the working directory.
These permissions must be set manually, this is required by the macOS security
policy. We think that this is not a problem because it is unlikely that you will
use a Mac machine as a server.
</p>
<p>You must click "allow" two times to:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> allow R to run 'AppleScript' scripts that will control Word
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> allow Word to write to the working directory.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This process is a one-time operation.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(locatexec)
if (exec_available('word')) {
  file &lt;- system.file(package = "doconv",
    "doc-examples/example.docx")

  out &lt;- docx2pdf(input = file,
    output = tempfile(fileext = ".pdf"))

  if (file.exists(out)) {
    message(basename(out), " is existing now.")
  }
}
</code></pre>
