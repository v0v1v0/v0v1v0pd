<h2>
Matrix holding mRNA counts
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Three treatments (3 samples each) were applied to Arabidopsis plants.
RNA-Seq technology was used to determine messenger RNA (mRNA) counts.
These were processed to remove counts for sequences that could not be 
identified as corresponding to a gene.  
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("plantStressCounts")</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The matrix <code>plantStressCounts</code> has 28775 rows,
and 9 columns.  Rows have the nondescript names
"Gene1" "Gene2" "Gene3" "Gene4" ... .  Columns are
named "CTL1", "CTL2", "CTL3", "Light1", "Light2", "Light3", 
"Drought1", "Drought2", "Drought3"
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The treatments were:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Control</dt>
<dd>
<p>Plants were grown under normal light and
watering conditions</p>
</dd>
<dt>Light stress</dt>
<dd>
<p>One hour of continuous exposure to light
at ten times the level that the plants are normally grown under</p>
</dd>
<dt>Drought stress</dt>
<dd>
<p>Nine days without water, causing wilting
of the leaves</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The interest is in how light and drought stress affect gene
expression to produce proteins.
</p>
