<h2>
Dividing chain.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Create the “dividing chain” of a Dirichlet tessellation.
The tessellation must have been created from a set of points
having associated “tags”.  The dividing chain consists
of those edges of Dirichlet tiles which separate points having
different values of the given tags.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">   divchain(x, ...)
   ## Default S3 method:
divchain(x, y, z, ...)
   ## S3 method for class 'deldir'
divchain(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>

<p>Either an object specifying coordinates (in the case of the
<code>"default"</code> method; see <code>deldir()</code> for details)
or an object of class “deldir”.  In the latter case this
object must have been created in such a way that the points of the
set being tessellated have associate categorical “tags”.
That is, <code>deldir()</code> must have been called with a
<code>z</code> argument or the <code>x</code> argument to  <code>deldir()</code>
must have had an appropriate component which could be taken to
be <code>z</code>.  Note that if the value of <code>z</code> that was used
was not a factor, it is coerced to one.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>

<p>A numeric vector constituting the <code class="reqn">y</code>-coordinates of the
set of points being tessellated.  See <code>deldir()</code>
for details.  Not used by the <code>"deldir"</code> method.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector or factor specifying “auxiliary” values or
“tags”.  If this argument is left <code>NULL</code> then it
is extracted, if possible, from the components of <code>x</code>.
See <code>deldir()</code> for further details.  If <code>z</code> is
not a factor it is coerced to one.  See <code>deldir()</code>
for details.  Not used by the <code>"deldir"</code> method.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>

<p>Arguments to be passed to <code>deldir()</code>.  Not used by
the <code>"deldir"</code> method.
</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class “divchain” consisting of a data frame
with columns named “x0”, “y0”, “x1”,
“y1”, “v01”, “v02”, “v03”,
“v11”, “v12” and “v13”.
</p>
<p>The columns named “x0” and “y0” consist of the
coordinates of one endpoint of an edge of a Dirichlet tile and
the columns named “x1” and “y1” consist of the
coordinates of the other endpoint.
</p>
<p>The columns named “vij”, i = 0, 1, j = 1, 2, 3, consist
of the indices of the vertices of the Delaunay triangles
whose circumcentres constitute the respective endpoints of the
corresponding edge of a Dirichlet tile.  The entries of column
“vi3” may (also) take the values $-1, -2, -3$, and $-4$.
This will be the case if the circumcentre in question lay outside
of the rectangular window <code>rw</code> (see <code>deldir()</code>)
enclosing the points being tessellated.  In these circumstances the
corresponding endpoint of the tile edge is the intersection of the
line joining the two circumcentres with the boundary of <code>rw</code>,
and the numeric value of the entry of column “vi3” indicates
which side.  The numbering follows the convention for numbering
the sides of a plot region in <code>R</code>: 1 for the bottom side,
2 for the left side, 3 for the top side and 4 for the right side.
</p>
<p>Note that the triple of vertices uniquely identify the endpoint
of the tile edge.
</p>
<p>The object has an attribute <code>rw</code> which is equal to
the specification of the rectangular window within which
the triangulation/tessellation in question was constructed.
(See <code>deldir()</code>.)
