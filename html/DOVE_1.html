<h2>Durability of Vaccine Efficacy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates the potentially waning long-term efficacy of vaccines in
randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with staggered
enrollment of participants and sequential crossover of placebo recipients.
The hazard ratio for the vaccine effect is a nonparametric 
function of time.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dove(formula, data, plots = TRUE, timePts = NULL, bandwidth = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula object, with the response on the left-hand side of a
'~' operator, and the covariates and vaccine() function on the right-hand side.  
The response must be a survival object as returned by the 'Surv'
function of the <span class="pkg">survival</span> package. See Details for further information.
The vaccine() function must be used to specify the entry time and
vaccination information. See ?vaccine and Details for further
information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data.frame object. The data.frame in which to interpret the
variable names in formula. Must contain the entry time, the event time,
the event status, the vaccination status,
the vaccination time, and any covariates. All time variables must
be provided in units of days. See Details.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plots</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical object. If TRUE, plots of the estimated
curve of vaccine efficacy in reducing attack rate and
the estimated curve of vaccine efficacy in reducing the hazard rate
will be automatically generated. If FALSE, plots will not be
generated, but the data are available through the returned value object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>timePts</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector object or NULL. The endpoints of the time 
periods for which the vaccine efficacy in reducing the attack rate is
to be shown. If NULL, a default sequence of 60-day intervals is used.
If tau &lt; 60 days, this input must be provided.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bandwidth</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric object. Tuning parameter for the 
bandwidth used for kernel estimation of the vaccine efficacy in 
reducing the hazard rate; this input is ignored if plots=FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In dove(), the hazard ratio for the vaccine effect is a nonparametric 
function of time for which
confidence intervals are not provided. The sister function, dove2(), 
assumes that the log hazard ratio for the vaccine effect is a piecewise 
linear function of time; 
it provides more precise and more stable estimates of vaccine efficacy on 
the hazard rate and includes proper confidence intervals.
</p>
<p>The information required for an analysis is 
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Entry Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when the participant enters the 
trial.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Event Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when the participant experiences
the clinical event of interest (e.g., symptomatic COVID-19) or their
follow-up ends, whichever occurs first.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Event Status:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Binary indicator taking value 1 if the clinical
event of interest occurs before the end of follow-up and 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vaccination Status:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Binary indicator taking value 1 if
vaccination occurs before the end of follow-up and 0 otherwise.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Vaccination Time:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calendar time when vaccination takes place,
with an arbitrary non-negative value if the participant is not vaccinated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Covariates:</dt>
<dd>
<p>Baseline covariates (e.g., priority group, age, 
ethnicity).</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Note that all times are to be specified relative to the start of the trial
and are specified in units of days. Thus, for individuals that received 
vaccination, entry_time &lt;= vaccination_time &lt;= event_time. And for
individuals that did not receive vaccination, 
entry_time &lt;= event_time; for these participants,
vaccination_time can take any non-negative value (including NA or Inf).
</p>
<p>The general structure of the formula input is
</p>
<pre>
  Surv(event_time, event_status) ~ covariates + 
    vaccine(entry_time, vaccination_time, vaccination_status)
  </pre>
<p>The response variable must be a survival analysis object as returned by the
'Surv()' function of package <span class="pkg">survival</span>, where event_time is the
observation time (formal argument 'time') and event_status is the status
indicator input (formal argument 'event'). Specifically, 
</p>
<pre>Surv(time = event_time, event = event_status)</pre>
<p>The covariates can include categorical variables, for which
all other categories are compared to the first category.
</p>
<p>The vaccination and entry_time information must be specified through function 
'vaccine()'. Specifically, 
</p>
<pre>vaccine(entry_time, vaccination_status, vaccination_time)</pre>
<p>For participants that did not receive the vaccine, vaccination_time
can take any non-negative value (including NA or Inf). For individuals
that received vaccination, if 
vaccination_time &gt; event_time, or vaccination_time &lt; entry_time, the 
case will be removed from the analysis and a message will be generated.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class DOVE containing a list with elements
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>covariates</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix containing the estimated hazard ratio of each
covariate, together with the (estimated) standard error, the 95%
confidence interval, and the two-sided p-value for testing no covariate
effect.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vaccine</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list containing two elements. The first element is
the matrix containing the estimates of the vaccine efficacy in
reducing the attack rate at all observed event 
times (VE_a), together with the 95% 
confidence intervals, as well as the vaccine efficacy in
reducing the hazard rate at these times (VE_h). These results 
will be shown in graphical form if input plots = TRUE.
The second element is the matrix containing the estimates of vaccine
efficacy in reducing the attack rate over successive time periods,
together with the 95% confidence intervals.
