<h2>Include or exclude peak information in the model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function <code>setPeakInfo</code> is used for including in the model
either the full peak height information or only information about
presence and absence of peaks. After a call to <code>setPeakInfo</code>,
the Bayesian networks in <code>mixture$domains</code> will represent
the conditional distribution given the specified peak
information. For the reverse functionality, i.e. exclusion of any
such peak information, use <code>removePeakInfo</code>.
</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: This is the <span class="pkg">DNAmixturesLite</span> package, which is intended as a service to enable users to try <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> without purchasing a commercial licence for Hugin. When at all possible, we strongly recommend the use of <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> rather than this lite-version. See <a href="https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/">https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/</a> for details on both packages.</em>
</p>
<p><em>While the lite-version seeks to provide the full functionality of <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span>, note that computations are much less efficient and that there are some differences in available functionality. Be aware that the present documentation is copied from <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> and thus may not accurately describe the implementation of this lite-version.</em>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">setPeakInfo(mixture, pars, presence.only = FALSE)

removePeakInfo(mixture)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mixture</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>DNAmixture</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pars</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>mixpar</code> model parameter</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>presence.only</code></td>
<td>
<p>Default is FALSE, which means that the full
peak height information is taken into consideration. Set to TRUE,
which will include only information on the presence and absence of peaks.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function <code>setPeakInfo</code> sets conditional
probability tables using the specified model parameters, and
propagates suitable evidence using either observed peak heights or
the discrete presence/absence observations of peaks. Any
previously entered or propagated evidence on nodes <code>O</code> and
<code>D</code> will be retracted in this process.
</p>
<p>The function <code>removePeakInfo</code> retracts all evidence on nodes
<code>O</code> and <code>D</code>; the conditional probability tables are left
unchanged.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>invisibly <code>NULL</code>
</p>
