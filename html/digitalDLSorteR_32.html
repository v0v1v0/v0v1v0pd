<h2>digitalDLSorteR: an R package to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq samples using
single-cell RNA-Seq data and Deep Learning</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">digitalDLSorteR</span> is an R package that allows to deconvolute bulk RNA-Seq
data using context-specific deconvolution models based on single-cell RNA-Seq
data and Deep Neural Networks. These models are able to make accurate
estimates of the cell composition of bulk RNA-Seq samples from the same
context using the advances provided by Deep Learning and the meaningful
information provided by scRNA-Seq data. See Torroja and Sanchez-Cabo (2019)
(<a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2019.00978">doi:10.3389/fgene.2019.00978</a>) for more details.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The foundation of the method consists of a process that starts from
single-cell RNA-Seq data and, after a few steps, a Deep Neural Network (DNN)
model is trained with simulated pseudo-bulk RNA-Seq samples whose cell
composition is known. These trained models are able to deconvolute any bulk
RNA-Seq sample from the same biological context by determining the proportion
of present cell types. The main advantage is the possibility to build
deconvolution models trained with real data from certain biological
environments. For example, to quantify the proportion of tumor infiltrated
lymphocytes (TILs) in breast cancer, a specific model for this type of
samples can be obtained by using this package. This overcomes the limitation
of other methods, since stromal and immune cells may significantly change
their transcriptional profiles depending on tissue and disease context.
</p>
<p>The package can be used in two ways: deconvoluting bulk RNA-Seq samples using
pre-trained models available on the digitalDLSorteRmodels R package or
building your own models trained with your own single-cell RNA-Seq data.
These new models may be published to make them available for other users
working with similar data. So far, available models allow deconvoluting
breast and colorectal cancer samples. See vignettes and
