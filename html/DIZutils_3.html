<h2>Combine aggregated statistics.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function provides the functionality to combine multiple
statistics to a single statistical overview. This is e.g. useful if you
are only allowed to export statistical characteristics from a site but
not the data itself. So in this case you have e.g. mean, median and N
from each site but want to say something about the mean, median and N
over all sites like you had the data of all sites in one big pool and
would do the statisitcs there.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>

Each row in this data table represents a site as of the example described
above.</p>
