<h2>A function that runs an app for specific settings and processes results for plot and text generation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function runs a model based on information
provided in the modelsettings list passed into it.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">run_model(modelsettings)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>modelsettings</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list with model settings. Required list elements are: <br>
modelsettings$simfunction - name of simulation function(s) as string.  <br>
modelsettings$is_mbmodel - indicate of simulation function has mbmodel structure
modelsettings$modeltype - specify what kind of model should be run.
Currently one of: _ode_, _discrete_, _stochastic_, _usanalysis_, _modelexploration_, _fit_. <br>
For more than one model type, place _and_ between them. <br>
modelsettings$plottype - 'Boxplot' or 'Scatterplot' , required for US app <br>
Optinal list elements are: <br>
List elements with names and values for inputs expected by simulation function.
If not provided, defaults of simulator function are used.<br>
modelsettings$plotscale - indicate which axis should be on a log scale (x, y or both).
If not provided or set to ‚Äù, no log scales are used. <br>
modelsettings$nplots -  indicate number of plots that should be produced (number of top list elements in result).
If not provided, a single plot is assumed.  <br>
modelsettings$nreps - required for stochastic models to indicate numer of repeat simulations.
If not provided, a single run will be done. <br></p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function runs a model for specific settings.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vectored list named "result" with each main list element containing the simulation results in a dataframe called dat and associated metadata required for generate_plot and generate_text functions. Most often there is only one main list entry (result[[1]]) for a single plot/text.
