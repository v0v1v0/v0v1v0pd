<h2>driveR: An R Package for Prioritizing Cancer Driver Genes Using Genomics Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cancer genomes contain large numbers of somatic alterations but few genes
drive tumor development. Identifying cancer driver genes is critical
for precision oncology. Most of current approaches either identify driver
genes based on mutational recurrence or using estimated scores predicting
the functional consequences of mutations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>driveR is a tool for personalized or batch analysis of genomic data for
driver gene prioritization by combining genomic information and prior
biological knowledge. As features, driveR uses coding impact metaprediction
scores, non-coding impact scores, somatic copy number alteration scores,
hotspot gene/double-hit gene condition, 'phenolyzer' gene scores and
memberships to cancer-related KEGG pathways. It uses these features to
estimate cancer-type-specific probabilities for each gene of being a cancer
driver using the related task of a multi-task learning classification model.
