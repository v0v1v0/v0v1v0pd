<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function allows to provide the incidence of 1,000 breast cancer patients within a period of 5 years
starting from beginning of 2009 to end of 2013. The survival times for those patients were computed. Among them, 703
people were still alive at the end of 2013 and 55 patients had a zero lifetime and were believed to be wrongly reported or
their records were absent upon death and thus excluded from the analysis. The remaining 242 patients have included.
