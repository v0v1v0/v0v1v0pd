<h2>duawranglr: Securely Wrangle Dataset According to Data Usage Agreement</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The guiding principle behind <code>duawranglr</code> is to make it easier
for organizations to share data with protected elements and/or
personally idenfiable information (PII) with researchers. There are
two key problems this package attempts to solve:
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ol>
<li>
<p> Data owners and
reseachers may collaborate on multiple projects under a single data usage
agreement (DUA), each with a different level of data security required.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Administrators tasked with approving data
requests do not always have the time or technical proficiency to
review the code that reads, subsets, filters, and deidentifies data
files according to a data usage agreement.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The duawranglr package uses a simple crosswalk file that lists
restricted variables according to security levels prespecified in a
DUA and a suite of functions that warn users about possible
violations of data usage agreement to prevent writing protected
elements. The DUA crosswalk can be an Excel spreadsheet, which
means that restricted data elements can be easily added and
approved by administrators.
</p>
<p>Functions in the package do not replace existing data wrangling
functions nor guarantee data security. But if used correctly, data
administrators can more easily participate in the data sharing
process and have more surety that data are being properly secured
before they are transferred to researchers.
</p>
<p>See the package vignette for more details about the motivation for
the package and an extended example use case.
