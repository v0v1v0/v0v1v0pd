<h2>BLAST Query File Against Local Database</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function takes fasta files as input along with a user selected NCBI
formatted database to BLAST sequences against. The outcome of the function are
two files, a BLAST run file and a single file containing all of the BLAST
results in tab delimited format (Note: there are no headers but the columns
are, query sequence ID, search sequence ID, search taxonomic ID, query to
sequence coverage, percent identity, search scientific name, search common
name, query start, query end, search start, search end, e-value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">seq_BLAST(
  databasePath = NULL,
  querySeqPath = NULL,
  blastnPath = "blastn",
  minLen = 100,
  BLASTResults = 200,
  numCores = 1,
  verbose = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>databasePath</code></td>
<td>
<p>The location of a file in a directory where the desired
BLAST database is located (Default NULL).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>querySeqPath</code></td>
<td>
<p>The location of a file in a directory containing all of the
fasta files wishing to be BLASTed (Default NULL).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blastnPath</code></td>
<td>
<p>The location of the NCBI blast+ blastn program (Default 'blastn').</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minLen</code></td>
<td>
<p>The minimum length of the sequences that will be BLASTed (Default 100).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>BLASTResults</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of returned results, or the depth of the reported
results, saved from the BLAST (Default 200).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>numCores</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cores used to run the function (Default 1,
Windows systems can only use a single core).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>If set to TRUE then there will be output to the R console, if
FALSE then this reporting data is suppressed (Default TRUE).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The user input provides a location for the BLAST database you would like to
use by selecting a file in the target directory. Then provide the location
of the query sequence file(s) by indicating a file in a directory that contains
the fasta file(s) of interest. Provide the path for the blast+ blastn program. Finally, provide
the minimum query sequence length to BLAST (Default 100), the depth of the BLAST
returned results (default 200), and finally the number of cores to process
the function (Default 1, Windows implementation will only accept this value
as 1).
</p>
<p>The examples are present to display the syntax for the function.
These examples are not run because there are files required to run the functions,
in some cases multiple files are necessary and some of these are quite large. To
get specific examples please see https://github.com/rgyoung6/DBTCShinyTutorial/blob/main/README.md
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Two files are produced from this function, a BLAST run file and a BLAST results
file for each of the fasta files in the target directory.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>WARNING - NO WHITESPACE!
</p>
<p>When running DBTC functions the paths for the files selected cannot have white
space! File folder locations should be as short as possible (close to the root
as some functions do not process long naming conventions.
</p>
<p>Also, special characters should be avoided (including question mark, number
sign, exclamation mark). It is recommended that dashes be used for separations
in naming conventions while retaining underscores for use as information
delimiters (this is how DBTC functions use underscore).
</p>
<p>There are several key character strings used in the DBTC pipeline, the presence
of these strings in file or folder names will cause errors when running DBTC functions.
</p>
<p>The following strings are those used in DBTC and should not be used in file or folder naming:
- _BLAST
- _combinedDada
- _taxaAssign
- _taxaAssignCombined
- _taxaReduced
- _CombineTaxaReduced
</p>
