<h2>Run Models through a Sieve to Filter out Dubious Fits</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A set of fitted models (<code>ddArray</code>) is filtered according 
to a set of criteria that test for high AIC, high-influence points, and
plausibility of the tail probabilities of each fitted distribution.
<code>modelFilter</code> will either auto-select the best model according to a set
of pre-defined, objective criteria or will will return all models that meet
a set of user-defined, or default criteria. A table of how the models
score according to each criterion is printed to the console.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The criteria to test are entered in a list (<code>sieve</code>) with components:
</p>

<ol>
<li> <p><code>$rtail</code> = vector of probabilities that define a checkpoints on distributions
to avoid situations where a model that may fit well within the range of data
is nonetheless implausible because it predicts a significant or substantial 
probability of carcasses falling great distances from the nearest turbine. 
The default is to check whether or not a distribution predicts that less than 
50% of carcasses fall within 80 meters, 90% within 120 meters, 95% within 
150 meters, or 99% within 200 meters. Distributions that fall below any of 
these points (for example predicting only 42% within 80 meters or only 74% 
within 120 meters) fail the default <code>rtail</code> test. The format of the 
default for  the test is <code>$rtail = c(p80 = 0.5, p120 = 0.90, 
  p150 = 0.95, p200 = 0.99)</code>. Users may override the default by using, for example, 
<code>sieve = list(rtail = c(p80 = 0.8, p120 = 0.99, p150 = 0.99, p200 = 0.999))</code>
in the argument list for a more stringent test or for a situation where
turbines are small or winds are light. Alternatively, users may forego the
test altogether by entering <code>sieve = list(rtail = FALSE)</code>. If specific
probabilities are provided, they must be in a vector of length 4 with names
"<code>p80</code>" etc. as in the examples above.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>$ltail</code> = vector of probabilities that define checkpoints on distributions
to avoid situations where the search radius is short and a distribution that
fits the limited data set well but crashes to zero just outside the search
radius. The default is to check whether or not a distribution predicts that
greater than 50% of carcasses fall with 20 meters or 90% within 50 meters.
Distributions that pass above either of these checkpoints (for example
predicting 61% of carcasses within 20 meters or 93% within 50 meters)
are eliminated by the default <code>ltail</code> test. The format of the default for
the test is <code>$ltail = c(p20 = 0.5, p50 = 0.90)</code>. Users may override the
default by using, for example, <code>sieve = list(rtail = c(p20 = 0.6, p50 = 0.8))</code>
in the argument list for a situation where it is known that carcasses beyond
50 meters are common.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>$aic</code> = a numeric scalar cutoff value for model's delta AICc
scores. Models with AICc scores exceeding the minimum AICc among all the 
fitted models by <code>sieve$aic</code> or more fail the test. The default value 
is 10. Users may override the default by using, for example, 
<code>sieve = list(aic = 7)</code> in the argument list to use a delta AIC score 
of 7 as the cutoff or may forego the test altogether by setting 
<code>sieve = list(aic = FALSE)</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>$hin</code> = <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> to test for high influence points,
the presence of which cast doubt on the reliability of the model. The function
defines "high influence" as models with high leverage points, namely, points
with <code class="reqn">\frac{h}{1 - h} &gt;  \frac{2p}{n - 2p}</code> 
(where <code class="reqn">h</code> is leverage, <code class="reqn">p</code> is the number of parameters in the model, 
and <code class="reqn">n</code> is the search radius) with Cook's distance <code>&gt; 8/(n - 2*p)</code>. 
The criteria for high influence points were adapted from Brian Ripley's GLM 
diagnostics package <code>boot</code> (<code>glm.diag</code>). The test is 
perhaps most valuable in identifying distributions with high probability of 
carcasses landing well beyond what could reasonably be expected.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Several choices of pre-defined <code>sieve</code>s are available (or, as described 
above, users may define their own criteria):
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>sieve = "default"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The models are ordered by the following
criteria: 
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> extensibility
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> weight of right tail (discounting models that predict implausibly 
high proportions of carcasses beyond the search radius)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> weight of the left tail (discounting models that predict implausibly 
high proportions of carcasses near the turbines)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> AICc test (discounting models with delta AICc &gt; 10)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> high influence points (discounting models in which one or more of the
data points exert a high influence on the fitted model, according to 
Ripley's GLM  diagnostics package <code>boot</code> (<code>glm.diag</code>))
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ranking by AICc
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Precise definitions of the default sieve parameters are given in 
<code>sieve_default</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sieve = NULL</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Returns a list of the extensible models without
scoring them by other model selection criteria.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sieve = "win"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Sorts models by high-influence points and AICc</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sieve = list(&lt;custom&gt;)</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>User provides a custom sieve, which may
be a modification of the default sieve or de novo. To modify the default,
use, for example, <code>sieve = list(hin = FALSE)</code> to disable the <code>hin</code>
test but keep the other default tests, or <code>sieve = list(aic = 7)</code> to
use 7 rather than 10 as the AIC cutoff, or 
<code>sieve = list(ltail = c(p20 = 0.3, p50 = 0.8))</code> to use a more stringent 
left tail test that requires CDF graphs to pass below the points (20, 0.3) 
and (50, 0.8). Custom <code>ltail</code> and <code>rtail</code> parameters must match the 
formats of the default tests, but their probabilities may vary. To turn off
the <code>aic</code> filter, use <code>sieve = list(aic = Inf)</code>. To turn off the
<code>ltail</code> filter, use  <code>sieve = list(ltail = c(p20 = 1, p50 = 1))</code>.
To turn off the <code>rtail</code> filter, use 
<code>sieve = list(rtail = c(p80 = 0, p120 = 0, p150 = 0, p200 = 0))</code>. These
custom components may be mixed and matched as desired.</p>

<p>When a <code>fmod</code> object is printed, only a small subset of the elements are

is the name of the <code>fmod</code> return value. The elements
can be extracted in the usual R way via, for example, <code>x$sieve</code> or 
<code>x[["sieve"]]</code>.
