<h2>diagonals</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Several tools for handling block-matrix diagonals and similar
constructs are implemented. Block-diagonal matrices can be extracted or removed
using two small functions implemented here. In addition, non-square matrices
are supported. Block diagonal matrices occur when two dimensions of a data set
are combined along one edge of a matrix. For example, trade-flow data in the
decompr' and 'gvc' packages have each country-industry combination occur along
both edges of the matrix.
