<h2>DCchoice: a package for analyzing dichotomous choice contingent valuation data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package provides functions for analyzing single-, one-and-one-half-, and double-bounded dichotomous 
choice contingent valuation (CV) data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for analyzing single-, one-and-one-half-, and double-bounded dichotomous 
choice contingent valuation (CV) data.
</p>
<p>In the single-bounded dichotomous choice (SBDC) CV that was first proposed by Bishop and Heberlein (1979) 
respondents are requested to answer a question like the following:
</p>
<p><strong>If the environmental policy burdens you with USD <code class="reqn">X</code> annually, would you agree or disagree to it?</strong><br></p>
<p>This format, respondents only states "yes (I agree)" or "no (I disagree)," meaning whether their 
willingness to pay (WTP) is greater or lower than the bid (USD <code class="reqn">X</code>) they are offered.
</p>
<p>The double-bounded dichotomous choice (DBDC) CV was proposed by Hanemann (1985) 
and Carson (1985) to improve the efficiency of SBDC-CV. 
In the CV format, respondents are requested to answer the second (follow-up) question 
just after they answer the SBDC-CV style question 
(the first/initial question). An example of DBDC-CV 
questions is as follows (<code class="reqn">Xl &lt; X &lt; Xh</code>):
</p>
<p>First question<br><strong>If the environmental policy burdens you with USD <code class="reqn">X</code> annually, would you agree or disagree to it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Second question for the respondents who agree to the policy in the first question<br><strong>If the amount of tax is USD <code class="reqn">Xh</code>, would you agree or disagree to it?</strong>
</p>
<p>Second question for the respondents who disagree to the policy in the first question<br><strong>If the amount of tax is USD <code class="reqn">Xl</code>, would you agree or disagree to it?</strong>
</p>
<p>In the DBDC-CV question, there are four possible response 
outcomes: (yes, yes); (yes, no); (no, yes); and (no, no). If the respondent <code class="reqn">i</code>'s answer 
is (yes, yes), the analyst can tell <code class="reqn">WTPi &gt; Xh</code> (<code class="reqn">WTPi</code> is the WTP of the 
respondent <code class="reqn">i</code>). Similarly, (yes, no) means <code class="reqn">X &lt; WTPi &lt; Xh</code>, (no, yes) means 
<code class="reqn">Xl &lt; WTPi &lt; X</code>, and (no, no) means <code class="reqn">WTPi &lt;Xl</code>.
</p>
<p>One-and-one-half-bound dichotomous choice (OOHBDC) CV, which was developed by Cooper et al. (2002), 
is an intermediate CV format between SBDC-CV format and DBDC-CV format. 
</p>
<p>In the OOHBDC-CV survey, after answering the first SBDC-CV style question (the first stage), 
only respondents who satisfy certain conditions are requested to answer an additional 
SBDC-CV style question (the second stage). Details in the OOHBDC-CV survey are as follows: 
</p>
<p>Step 1) A list of bid ranges [BLj, BHj] (j = 1, 2, ..., J), where BLj &lt; BHj, 
are decided: i.e., [BL1, BH1], [BL2, BH2], ..., and [BLJ, BHJ]. 
</p>
<p>Step 2) One of the bid ranges is randomly presented to respondents (e.g., a bid range of [BL3, BH3] for j = 3).
</p>
<p>Step 3) One of the two bids presented to the respondents is selected randomly 
(i.e., BL3 or BH3 in the case of step 2 example) and then the respondents are asked 
whether they would be willing to pay the amount of the bid selected (the first stage).
</p>
<p>Step 4) The respondents are asked to answer the second stage if they satisfy either condition: 
(a) their answer in the first stage is "yes" when the lower bid is presented in the first stage, 
or (b) their answer in the first stage is "no" when the higher bid is presented in the first stage. 
</p>
<p>Therefore, there are six possible responses to the OOHBDC-CV survey: "no", "yes-no", and "yes-yes" 
when the lower bid is shown in the first stage; and "yes", "no-yes", and "no-no" when the higher bid is
shown in the first stage. Refer to Cooper et al. (2002) for detailed explanation of OOHBDC-CV, 
including the example CV questions.
</p>
<p>There are two ways of estimating WTP from the SBDC-, OOHBDC-, and DBDC-CV: 
parametric and nonparametric approaches. In this package, the functions <code>sbchoice</code>, 
<code>oohbchoice</code>, and <code>dbchoice</code>, which are based on the utility difference 
approach (Hanemann, 1984), are developed for the parametric approach to SBDC, OOHBDC, and DBDC data, 
respectively. 
</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for the estimates of WTPs are constructed by two methods. 
These are the Krinsky and Robb (1986, 1990)'s method and the bootstrap one. 
The former is implemented by  <code>krCI</code> while the latter by <code>bootCI</code>. 
</p>
<p>Both of the methods rely on simulation techniques with different settings. Usually, 
a bootstrap method takes much longer time than the Krinsky and Robb's method does. 
It has been pointed out that each method has both advantages and disadvantages, see, 
for instance, the discussions in Hole (2007) and the references therein. 
</p>
<p>Functions for nonparametric approaches are also included in the package. <code>kristrom</code> 
(Kristrom, 1990) and <code>turnbull.sb</code> (Carson and Steinberg, 1990) are designed for 
analyses for SBDC data, whereas <code>turnbull.oohb</code> and <code>turnbull.db</code> 
(Carson and Hanemann, 2005) for OOHBDC and DBDC ones, respectively.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p><span class="pkg">DCchoice</span> depends on <span class="pkg">interval</span> (Fay and Shaw, 2010) package. 
It further depends on several packages, among which <span class="pkg">Icens</span> 
(Gentleman and Vandal, 2011) package may not be installed by the GUI Package Installer 
accessible from the menu bar (Windows and Mac OS) 
because it is available only from <a href="http://bioconductor.org/">Bioconductor</a>. 
</p>
<p>To install <span class="pkg">DCchoice</span> and other dependent packages simultaneously, use the 
<code>install.packages</code> function instead. See the <b>Examples</b> section for the 
code.
