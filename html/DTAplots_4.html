<h2> Samples of the posterior distributions obtained from a Bayesian HSROC meta-analysis model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This dataset provides a sample from the posterior distributions of the various parameters resulting from a Bayesian hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic (HSROC) meta-analysis model, that are needed to create a SROC plot in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) space.
</p>
<p>The posterior samples were obtained by fitting the HSROC model using the rjags package to data from a systematic review of anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (anti-CCP) for rheumatoid arthritis.  Overall, 37 studies were meta-analyzed, a total of 3 chains were used with 14,000 burn-in iterations after which we drew 1,000 samples from the posterior distributions for the following parameters:
</p>
<p>“THETA” for the overall mean cut-off value for defining a positive test (threshold parameter). <br>
“LAMBDA” for the overall difference in means (accuracy parameter). <br>
“beta” for the logarithm of the ratio of the standard deviation of test results among patients with and without the disease. <br>
“tau[1]” for the standard deviation of the accuracy parameter. <br>
“tau[2]” for the standard deviation of the threshold parameter. <br>
“se” for the individual logit-transformed sensitivity. <br>
“sp” for the individual logit-transformed specificity. <br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(posterior_samples_HSROC)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A matrix with 3,000 samples from the posterior distribution for each of the 79 parameters listed in the description above.
