<h2>Check table relations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>All <code>check_cardinality_...()</code> functions test the following conditions:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> Are all rows in <code>x</code> unique?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Are the rows in <code>y</code> a subset of the rows in <code>x</code>?
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Does the relation between <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> meet the cardinality requirements?
One row from <code>x</code> must correspond to the requested number of rows in <code>y</code>,
e.g. <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠_0_1⁠</code> means that there must be zero or one rows in <code>y</code> for each
row in <code>x</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><code>examine_cardinality()</code> also checks the first two points and subsequently determines the type of cardinality.
</p>
<p>For convenience, the <code>x_select</code> and <code>y_select</code> arguments allow restricting the check
to a set of key columns without affecting the return value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">check_cardinality_0_n(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  x_select = NULL,
  y_select = NULL,
  by_position = NULL
)

check_cardinality_1_n(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  x_select = NULL,
  y_select = NULL,
  by_position = NULL
)

check_cardinality_1_1(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  x_select = NULL,
  y_select = NULL,
  by_position = NULL
)

check_cardinality_0_1(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  x_select = NULL,
  y_select = NULL,
  by_position = NULL
)

examine_cardinality(
  x,
  y,
  ...,
  x_select = NULL,
  y_select = NULL,
  by_position = NULL
)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All cardinality functions accept a parent and a child table (<code>x</code> and <code>y</code>).
All rows in <code>x</code> must be unique, and all rows in <code>y</code> must be a subset of the
rows in <code>x</code>.
The <code>x_select</code> and <code>y_select</code> arguments allow restricting the check
to a set of key columns without affecting the return value.
If given, both arguments must refer to the same number of key columns.
</p>
<p>The cardinality specifications "0_n", "1_n", "0_1", "1_1" refer to the expected relation that the child table has with the parent table.
"0", "1" and "n" refer to the occurrences of value combinations
in <code>y</code> that correspond to each combination in the
columns of the parent table.
"n" means "more than one" in this context, with no upper limit.
</p>
<p><strong>"0_n"</strong>: no restrictions, each row in <code>x</code> has at least 0 and at most
n corresponding occurrences in <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>"1_n"</strong>: each row in <code>x</code> has at least 1 and at most
n corresponding occurrences in <code>y</code>.
This means that there is a "surjective" mapping from the child table
to the parent table, i.e. each parent table row exists at least once in the
child table.
</p>
<p><strong>"0_1"</strong>: each row in <code>x</code> has at least 0 and at most
1 corresponding occurrence in <code>y</code>.
This means that there is a "injective" mapping from the child table
to the parent table, i.e. no combination of values in the
parent table columns is addressed multiple times.
But not all parent table rows have to be referred to.
</p>
<p><strong>"1_1"</strong>: each row in <code>x</code> occurs exactly once in <code>y</code>.
This means that there is a "bijective" ("injective" AND "surjective") mapping
between the child table and the parent table, i.e. the
sets of rows are identical.
</p>
<p>Finally, <code>examine_cardinality()</code> tests for and returns the nature of the relationship
(injective, surjective, bijective, or none of these)
between the two given sets of columns.
If either <code>x</code> is not unique or there are rows in <code>y</code> that are missing from <code>x</code>,
the requirements for a cardinality test is not fulfilled.
No error will be thrown, but
the result will contain the information which prerequisite was violated.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>check_cardinality_...()</code> return <code>x</code>, invisibly,
if the check is passed, to support pipes.
Otherwise an error is thrown and the reason for it is explained.
</p>
<p><code>examine_cardinality()</code> returns a character variable specifying the type of relationship between the two columns.
</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">d1 &lt;- tibble::tibble(a = 1:5)
d2 &lt;- tibble::tibble(a = c(1:4, 4L))
d3 &lt;- tibble::tibble(c = c(1:5, 5L), d = 0)
# This does not pass, `a` is not unique key of d2:
try(check_cardinality_0_n(d2, d1))

# Columns are matched by name by default:
try(check_cardinality_0_n(d1, d3))

# This passes, multiple values in d3$c are allowed:
check_cardinality_0_n(d1, d2)

# This does not pass, injectivity is violated:
try(check_cardinality_1_1(d1, d3, y_select = c(a = c)))
try(check_cardinality_0_1(d1, d3, x_select = c(c = a)))

# What kind of cardinality is it?
examine_cardinality(d1, d3, x_select = c(c = a))
examine_cardinality(d1, d2)
