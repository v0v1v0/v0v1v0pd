<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To investigate the number of goals scored per match in the 2018 FIFA World Cup,
<code>FIFA2018</code> provides two rows, one for each team, for each of the matches
during the tournament. In addition some basic meta-information for the matches
(an ID, team name abbreviations, type of match, group vs. knockout stage),
information on the estimated log-ability for each team is provided. These
have been estimated by Zeileis et al. (2018) prior to the start of the
tournament (2018-05-20) based on quoted odds from 26 online bookmakers using
the bookmaker consensus model of Leitner et al. (2010). The difference in
log-ability between a team and its opponent is a useful predictor for the
number of goals scored.
</p>
<p>To model the data a basic Poisson regression model provides a good fit.
This treats the number of goals by the two teams as independent given the
ability difference which is a reasonable assumption in this data set.

from Zeileis et al. (2018) based on quoted odds from Oddschecker.com and Bwin.com.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## load data
data("FIFA2018", package = "distributions3")

## observed relative frequencies of goals in all matches
obsrvd &lt;- prop.table(table(FIFA2018$goals))

## expected probabilities assuming a simple Poisson model,
## using the average number of goals across all teams/matches
## as the point estimate for the mean (lambda) of the distribution
p_const &lt;- Poisson(lambda = mean(FIFA2018$goals))
p_const
expctd &lt;- pdf(p_const, 0:6)

## comparison: observed vs. expected frequencies
## frequencies for 3 and 4 goals are slightly overfitted
## while 5 and 6 goals are slightly underfitted
cbind("observed" = obsrvd, "expected" = expctd)

## instead of fitting the same average Poisson model to all
## teams/matches, take ability differences into account
m &lt;- glm(goals ~ difference, data = FIFA2018, family = poisson)
summary(m)
## when the ratio of abilities increases by 1 percent, the
## expected number of goals increases by around 0.4 percent

## this yields a different predicted Poisson distribution for
## each team/match
p_reg &lt;- Poisson(lambda = fitted(m))
head(p_reg)

## as an illustration, the following goal distributions
## were expected for the final (that France won 4-2 against Croatia)
p_final &lt;- tail(p_reg, 2)
p_final
pdf(p_final, 0:6)
## clearly France was expected to score more goals than Croatia
## but both teams scored more goals than expected, albeit not unlikely many

## assuming independence of the number of goals scored, obtain
## table of possible match results (after normal time), along with
## overall probabilities of win/draw/lose
res &lt;- outer(pdf(p_final[1], 0:6), pdf(p_final[2], 0:6))
sum(res[lower.tri(res)]) ## France wins
sum(diag(res))           ## draw
sum(res[upper.tri(res)]) ## France loses

## update expected frequencies table based on regression model
expctd &lt;- pdf(p_reg, 0:6)
head(expctd)
expctd &lt;- colMeans(expctd)
cbind("observed" = obsrvd, "expected" = expctd)
