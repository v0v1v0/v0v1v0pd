<h2>Virtual Class "disaggR" Class of disaggregations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>"disaggR"</code> class is a class contained by the actual disaggregation
classes in the disaggR package. It is a “virtual” class.  disaggR classes are
minimalist S4 classes, containing disaggR and list. This allows Ops group
generic double dispatch but most of the package rather uses S3 methods.
