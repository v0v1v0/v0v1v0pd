<h2>Locale used by <code>arrange()</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This page documents details about the locale used by <code>arrange()</code> when
ordering character vectors.
</p>


<h4>Default locale</h4>

<p>The default locale used by <code>arrange()</code> is the C locale. This is used when
<code>.locale = NULL</code> unless the <code>dplyr.legacy_locale</code> global option is set to
<code>TRUE</code>. You can also force the C locale to be used unconditionally with
<code>.locale = "C"</code>.
</p>
<p>The C locale is not exactly the same as English locales, such as <code>"en"</code>. The
main difference is that the C locale groups the English alphabet by <em>case</em>,
while most English locales group the alphabet by <em>letter</em>. For example,
<code>c("a", "b", "C", "B", "c")</code> will sort as <code>c("B", "C", "a", "b", "c")</code> in the
C locale, with all uppercase letters coming before lowercase letters, but
will sort as <code>c("a", "b", "B", "c", "C")</code> in an English locale. This often
makes little practical difference during data analysis, because both return
identical results when case is consistent between observations.
</p>



<h4>Reproducibility</h4>

<p>The C locale has the benefit of being completely reproducible across all
supported R versions and operating systems with no extra effort.
</p>
<p>If you set <code>.locale</code> to an option from <code>stringi::stri_locale_list()</code>, then
stringi must be installed by anyone who wants to run your code. If you
utilize this in a package, then stringi should be placed in <code>Imports</code>.
</p>



<h4>Legacy behavior</h4>

<p>Prior to dplyr 1.1.0, character columns were ordered in the system locale. If
you need to temporarily revert to this behavior, you can set the global
option <code>dplyr.legacy_locale</code> to <code>TRUE</code>, but this should be used sparingly and
you should expect this option to be removed in a future version of dplyr. It
is better to update existing code to explicitly use <code>.locale</code> instead. Note
that setting <code>dplyr.legacy_locale</code> will also force calls to <code>group_by()</code> to
use the system locale when internally ordering the groups.
</p>
<p>Setting <code>.locale</code> will override any usage of <code>dplyr.legacy_locale</code>.
</p>



<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
df &lt;- tibble(x = c("a", "b", "C", "B", "c"))
df

# Default locale is C, which groups the English alphabet by case, placing
# uppercase letters before lowercase letters.
arrange(df, x)

# The American English locale groups the alphabet by letter.
# Explicitly override `.locale` with `"en"` for this ordering.
arrange(df, x, .locale = "en")

# This Danish letter is expected to sort after `z`
df &lt;- tibble(x = c("o", "p", "\u00F8", "z"))
df

# The American English locale sorts it right after `o`
arrange(df, x, .locale = "en")

# Using `"da"` for Danish ordering gives the expected result
arrange(df, x, .locale = "da")

# If you need the legacy behavior of `arrange()`, which respected the
# system locale, then you can set the global option `dplyr.legacy_locale`,
# but expect this to be removed in the future. We recommend that you use
# the `.locale` argument instead.
rlang::with_options(dplyr.legacy_locale = TRUE, {
  arrange(df, x)
})
