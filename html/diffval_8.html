<h2>Total Differential Value optimization using a Simulated Annealing (and GRASP)
algorithm(s)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function searches for <code>k</code>-partitions of the columns of a given matrix
(i.e., a partition of the columns in <code>k</code> groups), optimizing the Total
Differential Value (TDV) using a stochastic global optimization method
called Simulated Annealing (SANN) algorithm. Optionally, a Greedy
Randomized Adaptive Search Procedure (GRASP) can be used to find a initial
partition (seed) to be passed to the SANN algorithm.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Given a phytosociological table (<code>m_bin</code>, with rows corresponding to
taxa and columns corresponding to relevés) this function searches for a
<code>k</code>-partition (<code>k</code>, defined by the user) optimizing the TDV, i.e.,
searches, using a SANN algorithm (optionally working upon GRASP solutions),
for a global maximum of TDV (by rearranging the relevés into <code>k</code> groups).
</p>
<p>This function uses two main algorithms:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> An optional GRASP, which is used to obtain initial solutions
(partitions of <code>m_bin</code>) using function <code>partition_tdv_grasp()</code>.
Such initial solutions are then submitted to the SANN algorithm.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The (main) SANN algorithm, which is used to search for a global
maximum of TDV. The initial partition for each run of SANN can be a
partition obtained from GRASP (if <code>use_grasp = TRUE</code>) or, (if
<code>use_grasp = FALSE</code>), a partition given by the user (using <code>p_initial</code>) or
a random partition (using <code>p_initial = "random"</code>).
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The SANN algorithm decreases the temperature multiplying the current
temperature by <code>1 - alpha</code> according to a predefined schedule, which is
automatically calculated from the given values for <code>t_inic</code>, <code>t_final</code>,
<code>alpha</code> and <code>n_iter</code>.
Specifically, the cooling schedule is obtained calculating the number of
times that the temperature has to be decreased in order to approximate
<code>t_final</code> starting from <code>t_inic</code>. The number of times that the temperature
decreases, say <code>nt</code>, is calculated by the expression:
</p>
<p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠floor(n_iter/((n_iter * log(1 - alpha)) / (log((1 - alpha) * t_final / ⁠</code>
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠t_inic))))⁠</code>.
</p>
<p>Finally, these decreasing stages are scattered through the desired
iterations (<code>n_iter</code>) homogeneously, by calculating the indices of the
iterations that will experience a decrease in temperature using
<code>floor(n_iter / nt * (1:nt))</code>.
</p>
<p>SANN is often seen as an exploratory technique where the temperature
settings are challenging and dependent on the problem. This function tries
to restrict temperature values taking into account that TDV is always
between 0 and 1. Even though, obtaining values of temperature that allow
convergence can be challenging. <code>full_output = TRUE</code> allows the user to
inspect the behaviour of <code>current.tdv</code> and check if convergence fails.
Generally, convergence failure can be spotted when final SANN TDV values
are similar to the initial <code>current.tdv</code>, specially when coming from random
partitions. In such cases, as a rule of thumb, it is advisable to decrease
<code>t_final</code>.
