<h2>simulated data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing simulated data based on parameter values N = 1,2,...,50
, p = 0.0017  and f =0.1,0.2,...,0.5. The values of N were repeated 15 times
to generate  750 genes.  This dataset  contains 750 observational genes
with 5 experimental samples for each condition,  summarised as a 750 by 10
integer matrix. The first 428 genes are not differentially expressed
between the two conditions whereas the last 322 genes are. The gene counts
were generated in accordance to the probability distribution derived in
Ndifon et al.
