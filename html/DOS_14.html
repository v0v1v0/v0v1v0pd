<h2>
Robust Mahalanobis Distance Matrix for Optimal Matching
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes a robust Mahalanobis distance matrix between treated individuals and potential controls.  The usual Mahalnaobis distance may ignore a variable because it contains one extreme outlier, and it pays too
much attention to rare binary variables, but smahal addresses both issues.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">smahal(z, X)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>z is a vector that is 1 for a treated individual and 0 for a control.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>

<p>A matrix of continuous or binary covariates.  The number of rows of X must equal the length of z.
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The usual Mahalnaobis distance may ignore a variable because it contains one extreme outlier, and it pays too
much attention to rare binary variables, but smahal addresses both issues.
</p>
<p>To address outliers, each column of x is replaced by a column of ranks, with average ranks used for ties.  This prevents one outlier from inflating the variance for a column, thereby making large differences count little in the Mahalanobis distance.
</p>
<p>Rare binary variables have very small variances, p(1-p) for small p, so in the usual Mahalanobis distance, a mismatch for a rare binary variable is counted as very important.  If you were matching for US states as 49 binary variables, mismatching for California would not be very important, because p(1-p) is not so small, but mismatching for Wyoming is very important because p(1-p) is very small.  To combat this, the variances of the ranked columns are rescaled so they are all the same, all equal to the variance of untied ranks.  See Chapter 8 of Design of Observational Studies (2010).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The robust distance matrix has one row for each treated individual (z=1) and one column for each potential control (z=0).  The row and column names of the distance matrix refer to the position in z, 1, 2, ..., length(z).
