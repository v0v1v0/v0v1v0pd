<h2>Plots of the (estimated) within-class distributions of variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to visualise the (estimated) distributions of one or several variables for each of the classes of the outcomes.
This allows to study how exactly variables of interest influence the outcome, which is crucial for interpretive purposes.
Two types of visualisations are available: density plots and boxplots. See the 'Details' section below for further explanation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plotMcl(
  data,
  yvarname,
  varnames,
  plot_type = c("both", "density", "boxplot")[1],
  addtitles = TRUE,
  plotit = TRUE
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For the <code>"density"</code> plots, kernel density estimates (obtained using the 
<code>density()</code> function from base R) of the within-class distributions are 
plotted in the same plot using different colors and, depending on the number 
of classes, different line types. To account for the different number of
observations per class, each density is multiplied by the proportion of 
observations from that class. The resulting scaled densities can be interpreted 
in terms of the local density of the observations from each class relative to 
those from the other classes. For example, if a scaled density has the largest 
value in a particular region, this can be interpreted as the respective class 
being the most frequent in that region. Another example: If the scaled density 
of class "A" is twice as large as the scaled density of class "B" in a particular 
region, this can be interpreted to mean that there are twice as many observations 
of class "A" as of class "B" in that region.
</p>
<p>In the <code>"density"</code> plots, only classes represented by at least two 
observations are considered. If the number of classes is greater than 7, 
the different classes are distinguished using both colors and line styles. 
To indicate the absolute numbers of observations in the different regions, 
the locations of the observations from the different classes are visualized 
using a rug plot on the x-axis, using the same colors and line types as for 
the density plots. If the number of observations is greater than 1,000, a 
random subset of 1,000 observations is shown in the rug plot instead of all 
observations for visual clarity.
</p>
<p>The <code>"boxplot"</code> plots show the (estimated) within-class distributions 
side by side using boxplots. All classes are considered, even those represented 
by only a single observation. For the <code>plot_type="both"</code> option, which 
displays both <code>"density"</code> and <code>"boxplot"</code> plots, the boxplots are 
displayed using the same colors and ( if applicable) line styles as the kernel 
density estimates, for clarity. Boxplots of classes for which no kernel density 
estimates were obtained (i.e., those of the classes represented by single 
observations) are shown in grey. 
</p>
<p>Note that plots are only generated for those variables in <code>varnames</code> 
that have at least as many unique values as there are outcome classes. For 
categorical variables, the category labels are printed on the x- or y-axis 
of the <code>"density"</code> or <code>"boxplot"</code> plots, respectively. The rug plots 
of the <code>"density"</code> plots are produced only for numeric variables.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 

## Load package:

library("diversityForest")



## Plot "density" and "boxplot" plots (default: plot_type = "both") for the 
## first three variables in the "hars" dataset:

data(hars)
plotMcl(data = hars, yvarname = "Activity", varnames = c("tBodyAcc.mean...X", 
                                                         "tBodyAcc.mean...Y", 
                                                         "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"))


## Plot only the "density" plots for these variables:

plotMcl(data = hars, yvarname = "Activity", 
        varnames = c("tBodyAcc.mean...X", "tBodyAcc.mean...Y", 
                     "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"), plot_type = "density")

## Plot the "density" plots for these variables, but without titles of the
## plots:

plotMcl(data = hars, yvarname = "Activity", varnames = 
          c("tBodyAcc.mean...X", "tBodyAcc.mean...Y", "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"), 
        plot_type = "density", addtitles = FALSE)


## Make density plots for these variables, but only save them in a list "ps"
## without plotting them ("plotit = FALSE"):

ps &lt;- plotMcl(data = hars, yvarname = "Activity", varnames = 
                c("tBodyAcc.mean...X", "tBodyAcc.mean...Y", 
                  "tBodyAcc.mean...Z"), plot_type = "density", 
              addtitles = FALSE, plotit = FALSE)


## The plots can be manipulated later by using ggplot2 functionalities:

library("ggplot2")
p1 &lt;- ps[[1]] + ggtitle("First variable in the dataset") + 
  labs(x="Variable values", y="my scaled density")

p2 &lt;- ps[[3]] + ggtitle("Third variable in the dataset") + 
  labs(x="Variable values", y="my scaled density")


## Combine both of the above plots:

library("ggpubr")
p &lt;- ggarrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
p
