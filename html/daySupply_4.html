<h2>REWarDS</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Estimates patients' individualized average daily dose and subsequently, days' supply,
by fitting a random effects linear regression model to patients' cumulative dose over time.
Model parameters include a minimal universally-available set of variables from prescription
records.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">REWarDS(
  data,
  dspd_qty,
  strength,
  id,
  gap_handling = "none",
  permissible_gap = NULL,
  serv_date,

  Pt_level = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sample simulated data.
Data may have multiple rows per person (one row per prescription fill).
Required columns include:
1. ID: Patient's unique identification number
2. ServDate: Date on which each prescription was filled.
3. DSPD_QTY: Dispensed quantity: Number of tablets dispensed to patient at each prescription fill.
4. strength: Strength of the tablets dispensed.</p>

<p>Method to handle gaps between prescription fills that are more than
the permissible gap. Currently, gaps can be handled in three ways:
1) The “None” method: This is the default and it ignores gaps
2)The “Initial consecutive Rx” method: Starting from the first
prescription fill, patients' prescription refills are considered
until the permissible gap is exceeded. REWarDS uses these initial
prescription refills to estimates patient's individualized daily
dose. If the permissible gap is exceeded after the first fill,
there will only be one prescription for REWaRDS to use, and as of
now, REWarDS is unable to provide estimates of daily dose based on
a single prescription.
3) The “Longest consecutive Rx” method: Looks at all periods with
consecutive.
prescription refills with gaps between them that do not exceed the
permissible gap) during the follow up, it then counts the number of
prescription fills in each period, and picks the period with the
highest number of prescription fills and estimates the patient's
average daily dose during that period.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>REWarDS (Random Effects Warfarin Days' Supply) has been validated for warfarin. It
demonstrated excellent performance that was superior to all current alternative methods
for estimating days' supply of warfarin. REWarDS could potentially be used for other
medications with variable dosing regimens (e.g. tacrolimus), or in populations with
high inter-individual variability in drug clearance (e.g. elderly patients). Validation
with cohorts of such patients, or medications other than warfarin, has yet to be done.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>REWarDS returns a dataset called "REWarDS_result". This data set includes all the
variables originally in the data, plus the following:
</p>
<p>tot_dose_disp:            Total dose dispensed at prescription fill:
dispensed quantity x strength of the tablet dispensed.
</p>
<p>REWarDS_avg_daily_dose:   Patient's individualized average daily dose.
</p>
<p>REWarDS_Rx_DS:            Days' supply for prescription.
</p>
<p>REWarDS_Pt_DS:            Average days' supply for patient.
</p>
