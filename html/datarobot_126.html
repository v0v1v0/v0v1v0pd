<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>featurelistId</code></td>
<td>
<p>Unique alphanumeric identifier for the featurelist
to be retrieved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>DataRobot featurelists define the variables from the modeling
dataset used in fitting each project model. In most cases,
the same featurelist is used in fitting all project models,
but models can be fit using alternative featurelists using the
RequestNewModel function. To do this, featurelistId is required,
and this is one of the elements returned by the GetFeaturelist
function.
