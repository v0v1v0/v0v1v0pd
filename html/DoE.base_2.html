<h2> Function to add response values to an experimental design</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function allows to add numeric response variables to an experimental plan of 
class design. The responses are added both to the data frame and to its desnum 
attribute; the response.names element of the design.info attribute is updated - 
the function is still experimental. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add.response(design, response, rdapath=NULL, replace = FALSE, 
    InDec=options("OutDec")[[1]], tol = .Machine$double.eps ^ 0.5, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>design</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string that gives the name of a class <code>design</code> 
object, to which responses are to be added</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>response</code></td>
<td>
<p>EITHER 
</p>
<p>a numeric vector, numeric matrix or data frame with at least 
one numeric variable (the treatment of these is explained in the details section)
</p>
<p>OR
</p>
<p>a character string indicating a csv file that contains the typed-in response values; 
after reading the csv file with the csv version indicated in the <code>InDec</code> argument, 
numeric variables from response will be added to the design as responses </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rdapath</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character string indicating the path to a stored rda file that contains the 
design </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>replace</code></td>
<td>
<p> logical: TRUE implies that existing variables are overwritten in <code>design</code>; 
cf. also the details section</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>InDec</code></td>
<td>
<p> decimal separator in the external csv file; defaults to the 
<code>OutDec</code> option (viewable under <code>options("OutDec"</code>), 
and also governs whether the <code>csv</code>-file is read with <code>read.csv</code> or with 
<code>read.csv</code>: 
separator semicolon goes with decimal comma and triggers use of <code>read.csv2</code>, 
separator comma goes with decimal point and trigggers use of <code>read.csv</code>. )</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tol</code></td>
<td>
<p>tolerance for comparing numerical values;<br>
useful for designs with numeric factors and for partial replacement of response values;
the value is used in comparisons of design and response via <code>all.equal</code>; 
errors from peculiar rounding behavior of spreadsheet programs can be prevented by 
allowing a larger <code>tol</code> </p>
</td>

<p>further arguments; currently not used</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>If <code>response</code> is a data frame or a matrix, responses are assumed to be 
all the numeric variables that are neither factor names or block names in <code>design</code> 
(i.e. names of the <code>factor.names</code> element of the <code>design.info</code> attribute 
or the <code>block.name</code> element of that same attribute)  
nor column names of the <code>run.order</code> attribute, nor <code>name</code> or <code>Name</code>. 
</p>
<p>If <code>design</code> already contains columns for the response(s), NA entries of these 
are overwritten, if all non-NA entries coincide between <code>design</code> 
and <code>response</code>. 
</p>
<p>The idea behind this function is as follows:
After using <code>export.design</code> for storing an R work space with the 
design object and either a csv or html file externally, 
Excel or some other external software is used to type in experimental information. 
The thus-obtained data sheet is saved as a csv-file and imported into R again (name provided 
in argument <code>response</code>, and the design object with all attached information is 
linked to the typed in response values using function <code>add.response</code>.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, it is possible to simply type in experimental results in R, both 
using the R commander plugin (<span class="pkg">RcmdrPlugin.DoE</span>) or simply function <code>fix</code>. 
Copy-pasting into R from Excel is per default NOT possible, which has been the reason for programming this routine.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The value is a modified version of the argument object <code>design</code>, 
which remains an object of class <code>design</code> with the following modifications: 
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Response columns are added to the data frame
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the same response columns are added to the desnum attribute
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the <code>response.names</code> element of the <code>design.info</code> attribute is added or modified
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">       plan &lt;- fac.design(nlevels=c(2,3,2,4))
       result &lt;- rnorm(2*3*2*4)
       add.response(plan,response=result)
       ## direct use of rnorm() is also possible, but looks better with 48 
       add.response(plan,response=rnorm(48))
       
   ## Not run:    
       export.design(path="c:/projectA/experiments",plan)
       ## open exported file c:/projectA/experiments/plan.html
       ##        with Excel
       ## carry out the experiment, input data in Excel or elsewhere
       ##        store as csv file with the same name (or a different one, just use 
       ##        the correct storage name later in R), after deleting 
       ##        the legend portion to the right of the data area
       ##        (alternatively, input data by typing them in in R (function fix or R-commander)
       add.response(design="plan",response="c:/projectA/experiments/plan.csv",
                 rdapath="c:/projectA/experiments/plan.rda")
       ## plan is the name of the design in the workspace stored in rdapath
       ## assuming only responses were typed in
       ## should work on your computer regardless of system, 
       ##         if you adapt the path names accordingly
   
## End(Not run)
