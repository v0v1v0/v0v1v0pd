<h2>Statistical Inference for Mixed Samples of DNA (Lite-Version)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tools for statistical inference for one or multiple DNA mixtures.
</p>
<p><em>IMPORTANT: This is the <span class="pkg">DNAmixturesLite</span> package, which is intended as a service to enable users to try <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> without purchasing a commercial licence for Hugin. When at all possible, we strongly recommend the use of <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> rather than this lite-version. See <a href="https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/">https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org/</a> for details on both packages.</em>
</p>
<p><em>While the lite-version seeks to provide the full functionality of <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span>, note that computations are much less efficient and that there are some differences in available functionality. Be aware that the present documentation is copied from <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> and thus may not accurately describe the implementation of this lite-version.</em>
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package implements a statistical model for analysis
of one or more mixed samples of DNA in the possible presence of
dropout and stutter. Details of the model can be found in Cowell
et. al (2013), and details on the model checking tools and
Bayesian network structure can be found in Graversen and Lauritzen
(2014).
</p>
<p>Any hypothesis involving unknown contributors relies on
computations in a Bayesian network. For performing such
computations, <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> package relies on Hugin
(<a href="https://www.hugin.com">https://www.hugin.com</a>) through the <span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier; color: #666666;"><b>R</b></span>-package <span class="pkg">RHugin</span>. For an
installation guide, see the package webpage
<a href="https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org">https://dnamixtures.r-forge.r-project.org</a>.
</p>
<p>Although <span class="pkg">DNAmixtures</span> can be installed with only the free
version of Hugin, the size of the networks will in practice
require the full licence. In theory, the implementation allows
analysis with an arbitrary number of unknown
contributors. However, in practice, depending on hardware and
time-constraints working with up to 5 or 6 unknown contributors
seems realistic.
</p>


<h3>Summary of the statistical model</h3>

<p>The statistical model jointly models the observed peak heights and
the set of contributors to the DNA sample(s). In the event of
analysing multiple DNA mixtures, the union of the contributors is
used as the contributor set for each mixture. By allowing a
contribution of zero, we cover the case of a contributor not
having contributed to a particular mixture.
</p>
<p>Genotypes for unknown contributors are modelled using
allele-frequencies from a database specified by the user. The
database is also used to define the range of alleles at each
marker. A genotype for an unknown contributor is represented by a
vector of allele counts <code class="reqn">n_{ia}</code>, counting for each allele
<code class="reqn">a</code> the number of alleles <code class="reqn">i</code> that a person possesses; in
the network for a marker, the allele count <code class="reqn">n_{ia}</code> is
represented by a variable <code>n_i_a</code>. The vector of allele
counts follows a multinomial distribution with <code class="reqn">\sum_i n_{ia}
= 2</code> and the specified allele frequencies. It is assumed that
genotypes are independent across markers and between
contributors. If desired, the database of allele frequencies may
be corrected for F_st or sampling adjustment before use.
</p>
<p>Peak heights are assumed mutually independent and their
distributions for a fixed set of DNA profiles are modelled using
gamma distributions.  The peak height for allele <code class="reqn">a</code> in EPG <code class="reqn">r</code>
is assumed to follow a gamma distribution with scale parameter
<code class="reqn">\eta_r</code> and shape parameter
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\rho_r \sum_a ((1-\xi_{ra})n_{ia} + \xi_{r,a+1} n_{i,a+1})\phi_{ri}.</code>
</p>

<p>Applying a detection threshold <code class="reqn">C_r\ge 0</code>, any peak height
falling below the threshold is considered to be 0.  The peak
heights are denoted by <code>height1, ..., heightR</code>.
</p>
<p>The model parameters are for each DNA mixture
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code class="reqn">\phi</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The proportions of DNA from each contributor.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="reqn">\rho</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Amplification parameter, which will be larger for larger amounts of DNA amplified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="reqn">\eta</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Scale parameter for the gamma distribution.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code class="reqn">\xi</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Mean stutter percentage. Allele <code class="reqn">a</code> uses stutter parameter <code class="reqn">\xi_a = \xi</code> if the allele <code class="reqn">a-1</code> is included in the model, and <code class="reqn">\xi_a = 0</code> otherwise</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>An alternative parametrisation uses <code class="reqn">\mu = \rho \eta</code> and
<code class="reqn">\sigma = 1/\sqrt{\rho}</code>, which can be interpreted as the mean
peak height and the coefficient of variation respectively. Besides
being interpretable, an advantage of this reparametrisation is
that the parameters are fairly orthogonal.
</p>
<p>The model assumes the model parameters to be the same across
markers.  Relaxations of these assumptions are not implemented
here.
</p>


<h3>Computation by auxiliary variables</h3>

<p>The computational approach of the implementation of this package
is discussed in Graversen and Lauritzen (2014).
</p>
<p>The Bayesian networks include three types of auxiliary variables
<code>O</code>, <code>D</code>, and <code>Q</code>; these can be thought of as
representing the observed peak heights, the absence/presence of
peaks, and the peak height distribution function. Note that if
invalid tables are set – for instance if very extreme parameter
values are used, or if the vector of mixture proportions is
mis-labeled – then any subsequent propagation will fail. No
roll-back functionality has so far been implemented to fix this,
and the easiest solution is to re-fit the mixture model.
</p>
<p>The workhorses of this package are the functions
<code>setCPT.O</code>, <code>setCPT.D</code> and
<code>setCPT.Q</code> for setting the conditional probability
tables for the three types of auxiliary variables according to
specified peak heights and model parameters.
</p>


<h3>Amelogenin</h3>

<p>As an experiment, it is possible to add the
marker Amelogenin, provided that the marker is named "AMEL" and
that the coding of alleles X and Y is of a particular form. One
example of a suitable form is the coding X = 0 and Y = 1. The
allele frequencies used should then also contain a marker "AMEL",
and here frequencies have a slightly different interpretation than
for the rest of the markers; as all people possess one X, the
frequencies of X and Y denote the presence of an additional X or Y
respectively, and thus the frequencies correspond directly to the
proportions of the two genders.
