<h2>The Total Differential Value of a phytosociological table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a phytosociological table and a partition of its columns, this function
calculates the respective Total Differential Value (TDV).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">tdv(m_bin, p, output_type = "normal")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m_bin</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix. A phytosociological table of 0s (absences) and 1s
(presences), where rows correspond to taxa and columns correspond to
relevés.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integer numbers with the partition of the relevés (i.e.,
a k-partition, consisting in a vector with values from 1 to k, with length
equal to the number of columns of <code>m_bin</code>, ascribing each relevé to one of
the k groups).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character determining the amount of information returned
by the function and also the amount of pre-validations. Possible values are

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function accepts a phytosociological table (<code>m_bin</code>) and a
k-partition of its columns (<code>p</code>), returning the corresponding TDV.
TDV was proposed by Monteiro-Henriques and Bellu (2014).
Monteiro-Henriques (2016) proposed TDV1, modifying TDV slightly with the
objective of ensuring a value from 0 to 1. Yet, TDV is always within that
range. In practice, both TDV and TDV1 have 0 as possible minimum value
and 1 as possible maximum value, but TDV1 reduces further the contribution
of differential taxa present in more than one group. TDV is then
implemented here, for parsimony.
</p>
<p>TDV is calculated using the <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> index for each (and all) of the
taxa present in a tabulated phytosociological table <code class="reqn">M</code> (also called
sorted table). <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> index aims at characterizing how well a taxon
works as a differential taxon in a such tabulated phytosociological table
(for more information on differential taxa see Mueller-Dombois &amp; Ellenberg,
1974).
</p>
<p>An archetypal differential taxon of a certain group <code class="reqn">g</code> of the
partition <code class="reqn">p</code> (a partition on the columns of <code class="reqn">M</code>) is the one
present in all relevés of group <code class="reqn">g</code>, and absent from all the other
groups of that partition. Therefore, <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> has two components, an
inner one (<code class="reqn">\frac{a}{b}</code>), which measures the presence of the
taxon inside each of the groups, and an outer one (<code class="reqn">\frac{c}{d}</code>),
which measures the relevant absences of the taxon outside of each of the
groups. Specifically, given a partition <code class="reqn">p</code> with <code class="reqn">k</code> groups,
<code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> is calculated for each taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> as:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">DiffVal_{s,p} = \frac{1}{e}\sum_{g=1}^k{\frac{a}{b}\frac{c}{d}}</code>
</p>

<p>where:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">a</code>, is the total number of presences of taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> within group
<code class="reqn">g</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">b</code>, is the total number of relevés of group <code class="reqn">g</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">c</code>, is the total number of differentiating absences of taxon
<code class="reqn">s</code>, i.e., absences coming from the groups other than <code class="reqn">g</code> from
which the taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> is completely absent.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">d</code>, is the total number of relevés of all groups but <code class="reqn">g</code> (i.e.,
the total number of relevés in the table - <code class="reqn">b</code>).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">e</code>, is the total number of groups in which the taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> occurs
at least once.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, for each taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> and for each group <code class="reqn">g</code>, the
<code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> index evaluates:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\frac{a}{b}</code>, i.e., the frequency of the presences of taxon
<code class="reqn">s</code>, relative to the size of group <code class="reqn">g</code>; commonly called 'relative
frequency.' <code class="reqn">\frac{a}{b}</code> is only 1 if and only if taxon <code class="reqn">s</code>
occurs in all the relevés of group <code class="reqn">g</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code class="reqn">\frac{c}{d}</code>, i.e., the frequency of the differentiating
absences of taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> outside group <code class="reqn">g</code>, relative to the sum of
sizes of all groups but <code class="reqn">g</code>. <em>Nota bene</em>: absences in <code class="reqn">c</code> are
counted outside the group <code class="reqn">g</code> but only in the groups from which taxon
<code class="reqn">s</code> is completely absent (these are the relevant absences, which
produce differentiation among groups); in practice <code class="reqn">c</code> corresponds to
the sum of the sizes of all groups other than <code class="reqn">g</code> that are empty.
<code class="reqn">\frac{c}{d}</code> is 1 if and only if the taxon <code class="reqn">s</code> is absent
from all groups but <code class="reqn">g</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, <code class="reqn">\frac{1}{e}</code> ensures that <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> is a value
from 0 to 1.
</p>
<p>The Total Differential Value (TDV or <code class="reqn">TotDiffVal</code>) of a
phytosociological table <code class="reqn">M</code> tabulated/sorted by the partition <code class="reqn">p</code>
is:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">TDV_{M,p} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n{Diffval_{i,p}}</code>
</p>

<p>where:
</p>

<ul><li> <p><code class="reqn">n</code>, is the number of taxa in table <code class="reqn">M</code>.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p>The division by the number of taxa present in <code class="reqn">M</code> ensures that TDV
remains in the [0,1] interval (as <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> is also in the same
interval).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>output_type = "normal"</code> (the default) pre-validations are done
and a list is returned, with the following components:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ifp</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">\frac{a}{b}</code> values for each taxon
in each group, for short called the 'inner frequency of presences'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ofda</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">\frac{c}{d}</code> values for each
taxon in each group, for short called the 'outer frequency of
differentiating absences'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>e</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector with the <code class="reqn">e</code> values for each taxon, i.e., the
number of groups containing that taxon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>diffval</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> for each taxon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tdv</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric with the TDV of matrix <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠m_bin,⁠</code> given the partition
<code>p</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <code>output_type = "full"</code>, some extra components are added to the output:
<code>afg</code>, <code>empty.size</code>, <code>gct</code> (= <code class="reqn">e</code>) and <code>i.mul</code>. These are intermediate
matrices used in the computation of TDV.
</p>
<p>If <code>output_type = "fast"</code>, only TDV is returned and no pre-validations are
done.
