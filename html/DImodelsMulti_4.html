<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Data comes from a single site from a wider agrosdiversity experiment conducted in Belgium,
established in 2002. <br>
The four species used were Lolium perenne (G1), Phleum pratense (G2), Trifolium pratense (L1), and
Trifolium repens (L2). There are two recommended functional groupings: grouping grasses (G1, G2)
and legumes (L1, L2), or grouping fast-establishing species (G1, L1) and temporally persistent
species (G2, L2). <br>
One ecosystem function (aboveground biomass (t DM ha-1)) was recorded by summing recordings from
four harvests over each year, for three year.

## Modelling Example

# For a more thorough example of the workflow of this package, please see vignette
# DImulti_workflow using the following code:

# vignette("DImulti_workflow")


head(dataSWE)

# We begin by transforming the time identifier column to a factor, to better group coefficients

dataSWE$YEARN &lt;- as.factor(dataSWE$YEARN)

# We fit a repeated measures DI model using the main function DImulti().
# We begin by passing the initial species proportions column names through 'prop' and the
# response value column name through 'y'.
# As the data contains multiple time points, we include the 'time' parameter, through which we
# specify the column name containing the repeated measure indicator and the autocorrelation
# structure we want to use, in this case, we use compound symmetry (CS).
# The experimental unit ID is stored in the column "PLOT" and so we pass this to 'unit_IDs'.
# We request that the method fits an average interaction structure and we include the treatments
# DENS and TREAT as additional fixed effects.
# We opt to use the ML estimation method to allow for model comparisons with different fixed
# effects.
# Finally, we specify the data object, dataSWE, through 'data'.

SWEmodel &lt;- DImulti(y = "YIELD", time = c("YEARN", "CS"), unit_IDs = "PLOT",
                    prop = 5:8, data = dataSWE, DImodel = "AV",
                    extra_fixed = ~ 1:(DENS:TREAT),
                    method = "ML")

print(SWEmodel)

# We can now make any changes to the model's fixed effects and use a series of anovas (if the
# models are nested) or information criteria such as AIC, AICc, BIC, or BICc to select a final model
# We choose to change the interactions structure to functional groups, grouping the grasses and
# legumes, and simplify the extra_fixed terms, as an example, by only crossing the ID effect of G1
# with the treatments, and no longer crossing them with each other.

SWEmodel2 &lt;- DImulti(y = "YIELD", time = c("YEARN", "CS"), unit_IDs = "PLOT",
                    prop = 5:8, data = dataSWE, DImodel = "FG", FG = c("G", "G", "L", "L"),
                    extra_fixed = ~ G1_ID:(DENS+TREAT),
                    method = "ML")

BICc(SWEmodel); BICc(SWEmodel2)

# We select the model with the lower information criteria, which is our functional group model, and
# refit it using the "REML" estimation method, for unbiased estimates.
