<h2>Creates an igraph object from a data frame with self-loops</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an implementation of the method published in the paper "Intra-family links in the analysis of marital networks" (Merelo and Molinari 2024), which proposed a duplication of nodes that includes self-loops to get a reflect better (and include all information about) the status of all nodes in the network.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dup.nodes.from.data.frame(df,first.node="V1",second.node="V2")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>df</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data frame that should include at least two columns with the names of the nodes</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>first.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the node that's linked</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>second.node</code></td>
<td>
<p>The column that indicates the other node that's linked</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method duplicates nodes with self-loops, and links the duplicated nodes with the original with a weight that is equal to the number of self-loops.
</p>
<p>This can be applied to matrimonial networks where there are marriages among members of the same family, or any other type of network with self-loops, and allows to apply centrality (and other) measures, obtaining a meaningful and more accurate result.
</p>
<p>You can them compute "corrected" betweenness on the resulting object using the <code>DNSL.betweenness</code> function.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An igraph object with all nodes with self-loops duplicated. These newly created nodes will have the same name as the original, with a "'" added.</p>
