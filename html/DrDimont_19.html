<h2>Differential graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Exemplary intermediate pipeline output: Differential score graph example data built by
<code>generate_differential_score_graph</code> using the
interaction_score_graphs_example.
Consists of one graph containing edge attributes: the differential correlation values as
'differential_score' and the differential interaction score as 'differential_interaction_score'.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">differential_graph_example
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An iGraph graph object.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A subset of the original data by Krug et al. (2020) and randomly sampled metabolite
data from <code>layers_example</code> was used to generate the correlation
matrices, individual graphs and combined graphs. They were created from data
stratified by estrogen receptor (ER) status: 'groupA' contains data of ER+
patients and 'groupB' of ER- patients.
