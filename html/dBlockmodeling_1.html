<h2>
The notes borrowing network between social-informatics students
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data come from a survey conducted in May 1993 on 13 social-informatics
students (Hlebec, 1996). The network was constructed from answers to the question, “How often did you borrow notes from this person?” for each of the fellow students. The respondents indicated the frequency of borrowing by choosing (on a computer) a line of length 1–20, where 1 meant no borrowing. 1 was deducted from all answers, so that 0 now means no borrowing. The data was first used for blockmodeling in Žiberna (2007).

<h3>Usage</h3>
