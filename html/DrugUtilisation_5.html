<p>How two different continuous exposures are joined in an
era. There are four options:
"zero" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with a daily dose of zero. The
time between both exposures contributes to the total exposed time.
"join" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with a daily dose of zero. The
time between both exposures does not contribute to the total exposed time.
"previous" the exposures are joined considering that the period between both
continuous exposures the subject is treated with the daily dose of the
previous subexposure. The time between both exposures contributes to the
total exposed time.
"subsequent" the exposures are joined considering that the period between
both continuous exposures the subject is treated with the daily dose of the
subsequent subexposure. The time between both exposures contributes to the
total exposed time.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlapMode</code></td>
<td>
<p>How the overlapping between two exposures that do not
start on the same day is solved inside a subexposure. There are five possible
options:
"previous" the considered daily_dose is the one of the earliest exposure.
"subsequent" the considered daily_dose is the one of the new exposure that
starts in that subexposure.
"minimum" the considered daily_dose is the minimum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"maximum" the considered daily_dose is the maximum of all of the exposures in
the subexposure.
"sum" the considered daily_dose is the sum of all the exposures present in
the subexposure.</p>
