<h2>estimating DIFFerential networks via an Elementary Estimator under a
high-dimensional situation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is an R implementation of Fast and Scalable Learning of Sparse Changes
in High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Model Structure (DIFFEE). The DIFFEE
algorithm can be used to fast estimate the differetial network between two
related datasets. For instance, it can identify differential gene network
from datasets of case and control. By performing data-driven network
inference from two high-dimensional data sets, this tool can help users
effectively translate two aggregated data blocks into knowledge of the
changes among entities between two Gaussian Graphical Model. Please run
demo(diffeeDemo) to learn the basic functions provided by this package. For
further details, please read the original paper: Beilun Wang, Arshdeep
Sekhon, Yanjun Qi (2018) &lt;arXiv:1710.11223&gt;.

<p> We focus on
the problem of estimating the change in the dependency structures of two
p-dimensional Gaussian Graphical models (GGMs). Previous studies for sparse
change estimation in GGMs involve expensive and difficult non-smooth
optimization. We propose a novel method, DIFFEE for estimating DIFFerential
networks via an Elementary Estimator under a high-dimensional situation.
DIFFEE is solved through a faster and closed form solution that enables it
to work in large-scale settings. We conduct a rigorous statistical analysis
showing that surprisingly DIFFEE achieves the same asymptotic convergence
rates as the state-of-the-art estimators that are much more difficult to
compute. Our experimental results on multiple synthetic datasets and one
real-world data about brain connectivity show strong performance
improvements over baselines, as well as significant computational benefits.
