<em>Mirrour</em>. By 1660 <em>The Merchant's Mirrour</em> was in its third edition, and
its contents had been printed in the well-known merchant manual of Gerard
Malynes, <em>Consuetudo Vel Lex Mercatoira</em> since the 1636 edition, making it
one of the most popular bookkeeping manuals in 17th-century England. The
data set is meant to be used in conjunction with <code>dafforne_accounts</code>. It
contains the transactions in the practice journal and ledger that Dafforne
used to teach double-entry bookkeeping practices.
