<h2>Computes betweenness via duplication of nodes with self-loops for a graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the betweenness of nodes in a graph that includes self-loops directly.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DNSLbetweenness_for_graph(graph.with.self.loops)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph.with.self.loops</code></td>
<td>
<p>An <code>igraph</code> object some of whose nodes have connections with themselves (self-loops).</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This method computes betweenness centrality via the duplicated nodes method (Merelo and Molinari 2024) for a 'igraph' object. Use it when you want to just apply the DNSLbetweenness method to an already built graph. The intermediate graph obtained by duplicating nodes is hidden and discarded.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with DNSLbetweenness values for the nodes in the graph.</p>
