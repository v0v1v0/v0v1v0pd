<h2>droptest: Simulates LOX drop testing.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Generates simulated data representing the LOX drop testing
process (also known as impact testing). Drop testing is expensive, time
consuming, and notoriously difficult to analyze. A simulated process allows
for accelerated study of test behavior.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions are provided to simulate trials, test series, and groups of test
series. Functions for creating plots specific to this process are also
included. Test attributes and criteria can be set arbitrarily. This work is
not endorsed by or affiliated with NASA.
</p>
<p>Drop testing – sometimes called impact testing – is used to evaluate if a
material will interact with liquid oxygen (LOX). The material is exposed to
the LOX and an impactor is dropped onto the sample. Each drop is a bernoulli 
trial where a reaction is a failure and a non-reaction is a success. The
specified number of trials – until failure – completes one test.
</p>
<p>While fundamentally a binomial process, drop testing – performed by the
military and NASA – yields results that are difficult to analyze. Numerous
tech briefs and standards have attempted to address the problem (see below
for more information). Testing stops immediately once the failure condition
is reached. If the failure condition occurs on drop one or two – depending
on the failure criteria – then the test returns only one or two result
values. Alternatively, if a material passes, or if the failure condition
occurs on the last trial, then the test returns as many result values
as trials.
</p>
<p>Simulation can be used to examine the behavior of this test procedure.

<h3>Definitions</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><strong>Trial:</strong> A simulated bernoulli trial that represents one drop
of the impactor onto a material sample. Hence a trial is also referred to as
a drop. Where q is the probability of failure. A reaction is recorded as a
failure. Where p is the probability of success. A non-reaction is recorded
as a success. Where <code class="reqn">p = 1 - q</code>.
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_trial</a>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Drop Test:</strong> A collection of simulated trials (drops) generated
with equal parameters (q, number of trials, failure criteria, etc). When the
failure criteria is reached the test is immediately terminated and no more
trials are completed. The sooner a test reaches the failure criteria the
less total trials for that particular test. A test with no failures will
always contain the maximum number of trials as defined in the function
parameters.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Test Series:</strong> A collection of simulated drop tests. A group
number can be attached to the drop tests in a test series (optional).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Groups:</strong> A collection of multiple simulated test series. Each
batch of test series are identified with a group number. Within each group
test parameters will be identical.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>Trial Deviation:</strong> The average distance from q for the total
percent of reactions (failures).
