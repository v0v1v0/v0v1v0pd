<h2>spec_transaction_begin_commit_rollback</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>spec_transaction_begin_commit_rollback
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>dbBegin()</code>, <code>dbCommit()</code> and <code>dbRollback()</code> return <code>TRUE</code>, invisibly.
</p>


<h3>Failure modes</h3>

<p>The implementations are expected to raise an error in case of failure,
but this is not tested.
In any way, all generics throw an error with a closed
or invalid connection.
In addition, a call to <code>dbCommit()</code>
or <code>dbRollback()</code>
without a prior call to <code>dbBegin()</code> raises an error.
Nested transactions are not supported by DBI,
an attempt to call <code>dbBegin()</code> twice
yields an error.
</p>


<h3>Specification</h3>

<p>Actual support for transactions may vary between backends.
A transaction is initiated by a call to <code>dbBegin()</code>
and committed by a call to <code>dbCommit()</code>.
Data written in a transaction must persist after the transaction is committed.
For example, a record that is missing when the transaction is started
but is created during the transaction
must exist
both during
and after the transaction,
and also in a new connection.
</p>
<p>A transaction
can also be aborted with <code>dbRollback()</code>.
All data written in such a transaction must be removed after the
transaction is rolled back.
For example, a record that is missing when the transaction is started
but is created during the transaction
must not exist anymore after the rollback.
</p>
<p>Disconnection from a connection with an open transaction
effectively rolls back the transaction.
All data written in such a transaction must be removed after the
transaction is rolled back.
</p>
<p>The behavior is not specified if other arguments are passed to these
functions. In particular, <span class="pkg">RSQLite</span> issues named transactions
with support for nesting
if the <code>name</code> argument is set.
</p>
<p>The transaction isolation level is not specified by DBI.
