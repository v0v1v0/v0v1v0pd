<h2>Retrieve all modeling featurelists associated with a project</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In time series projects, a new set of modeling features is created after setting the
partitioning options. These features are automatically derived from those in the project's
dataset and are the features used for modeling. Modeling features are only accessible once
the target and partitioning options have been set. In projects that don't use time series
modeling, once the target has been set, ModelingFeaturelists and Featurelists will behave
the same.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">ListModelingFeaturelists(project)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>project</code></td>
<td>
<p>character. Either (1) a character string giving the unique alphanumeric
identifier for the project, or (2) a list containing the element projectId with this
identifier.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class 'listOfFeaturelists', which is a
list of dataframes: each element of the list corresponds to one
featurelist associated with the project, and each dataframe has
one row and the following four columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> featurelistId. Unique alphanumeric identifier for the featurelist.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> projectId. Unique alphanumeric project identifier.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> features. Comma-separated character string listing the variables included in the

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> name. Character string giving the name of the featurelist.
</p>

</ul>
