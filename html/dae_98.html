<h2>Takes a list of <code>projectors</code> and constructs a <code>pstructure.object</code> that includes projectors, each of which has been orthogonalized to all projectors preceding it in the list.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Constructs a <code>pstructure.object</code> that includes a 
set of mutually orthogonal projectors, one for each of the 
<code>projectors</code> in the <code>list</code>. 
These specify a structure, or an orthogonal decomposition of the 
data space. This function externalizes the process previously performed 
within <code>pstructure.formula</code> to orthogonalize 
<code>projector</code>s. There are three methods 
available for carrying out orthogonalization: <code>differencing</code>, 
<code>eigenmethods</code> or the default <code>hybrid</code> method. 
</p>
<p>It is possible to use this function to find out what sources 
are associated with the terms in a model and to determine the 
marginality between terms in the model. The marginality matrix 
can be saved.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'list'
porthogonalize(projectors, formula = NULL, keep.order = TRUE, 
               grandMean = FALSE, orthogonalize = "hybrid", labels = "sources", 
               marginality = NULL, check.marginality = TRUE, 
               omit.projectors = FALSE,

<td>
<p>An object of class <code>formula</code> from which the 
<code>projectors</code> have been obtained. If <code>NULL</code>, then 
the <code>differencing</code> option of <code>orthogonalize</code> is not available.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>keep.order</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>logical</code> indicating whether the terms should keep 
their position in the expanded <code>formula</code> projector, or 
reordered so that main effects precede two-factor 
interactions, which precede three-factor interactions and 
so on.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grandMean</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>logical</code> indicating whether the projector for the 
grand mean is to be included in the set produced.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>orthogonalize</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>character</code> vector indicating the method for orthogonalizing a 
projector to those for terms that occurred previously 
in the formula. Three options are available:  
<code>hybrid</code>; <code>differencing</code>; <code>eigenmethods</code>, 
unless <code>formula</code> is <code>NULL</code> in which case 
<code>differencing</code> is not available.
The <code>hybrid</code> option is the most general and uses the 
relationships between the projection operators for the 
terms in the <code>formula</code> to decide which 
<code>projector</code>s to substract and which to 
orthogonalize using eigenmethods. The <code>differencing</code> 
option subtracts, from the current <code>projector</code>, 
those previously orthogonalized <code>projector</code>s for 
terms whose factors are a subset of the current 
<code>projector</code>'s factors. The <code>eigenmethods</code> 
option recursively orthogonalizes the <code>projector</code>s 
using an eigenanalysis of each <code>projector</code> 
with previously orthogonalized <code>projector</code>s.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>character</code> nominating the type of labels to be used in 
labelling the projectors, and which will be used also 
in the output tables, such the tables of the aliasing 
in the structure. The two alternatives are <code>terms</code> and 
<code>sources</code>. Terms have all factors/variables in it 
separated by colons (<code>:</code>). Sources have factors/variables 
in them that represent interactions separated by hashes 
(<code>#</code>); if some factors are nested within others, the 
nesting factors are surrounded by square brackets 
(<code>[</code> and <code>]</code>) and separated by colons (<code>:</code>). 
If some generalized, or combined, factors have no marginal 
terms, the constituent factors are separated by colons 
(<code>:</code>) and if they interact with other factors in 
the source they will be parenthesized.</p>

<p>A square <code>matrix</code> that can be used to supply the

gives the marginalites of the terms in the formula. It must have 
the row and column names set to the terms from the expanded 
<code>formula</code>, including being in the same order as these terms. 
</p>
<p>The entry in the ith row and jth column will be one if the 
ith term is marginal to the jth term i.e. the column space of the 
ith term is a subspace of that for the jth term and so the source 
for the jth term is to be made orthogonal to that for the ith term. 
Otherwise, the entries are zero. A row and column should not be 
included for the grand mean even if <code>grandMean</code> is <code>TRUE</code>.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is envisaged that the <code>projectors</code> in the <code>list</code> 
supplied to the <code>projectors</code> argument correspond to the terms in a 
linear model. One way to generate them is to obtain the design matrix <b>X</b> 
for a term and then calculate its projector as 
<code class="reqn">\mathbf{X(X'X)^-X'}</code>, There are three methods available for 
orhtogonalizing the supplied projectors: <code>differencing</code>, 
<code>eigenmethods</code> or the default <code>hybrid</code> method. 
</p>
<p><code>Differencing</code> relies on 
comparing the factors involved in two terms, one previous to the 
other, to identify whether to subtract the orthogonalized projector 
for the  previous term from the primary projector of the other. It 
does so if factors/variables for the previous term are a subset of 
the factors/variablesfor for the other term. This relies on ensuring that all 
projectors whose factors/variables are a subset of the current 
projector occur before it in the expanded formula. It is checked that 
the set of matrices are mutually orthogonal. If they are not then 
a warning is given. It may happen that differencing does not produce 
a projector, in which case <code>eigenmethods</code> must be used.
</p>
<p><code>Eigenmethods</code> forces each projector to be orthogonal 
to all terms previous to it in the expanded formula. It uses 
equation 4.10 of James and Wilkinson (1971), which involves 
calculating the canonical efficiency factors for pairs of primary 
projectors. It produces a 
table of efficiency criteria for partially aliased terms. Again,
the order of terms is crucial. This method has the disadvantage that 
the marginality of terms is not determined and so sources names are set 
to be the same as the term names, unless a <code>marginality</code> matrix 
is supplied.
</p>
<p>The <code>hybrid</code> method is the most general and uses the relationships 
between the projection operators for the terms in the <code>formula</code> 
to decide which projectors to subtract and which to orthogonalize using 
eigenmethods. If <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i</code> and <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> are 
two projectors for two different terms, with <code class="reqn">i &lt; j</code>, then
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> if <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j\mathbf{Q}_i \neq \mathbf{0}</code> then 
have to orthogonalize <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> to <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> if <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j\mathbf{Q}_i = \mathbf{Q}_j</code>  
then,  if <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i = \mathbf{Q}_j</code>, they are equal 
and <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> will be removed from the list of terms; 
otherwise they are marginal and <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i</code> is subtracted 
from <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> if have to orthogonalize and 
<code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j\mathbf{Q}_i = \mathbf{Q}_i</code> then 
<code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> is aliased with previous terms and will be 
removed from the list of terms; otherwise <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i</code> is 
partially aliased with <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> and 
<code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_j</code> is orthogonalized to <code class="reqn">\mathbf{Q}_i</code> 
using eigenmethods.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The order of projections matrices in the <code>list</code> is crucial in this process.
</p>
<p>Of the three methods, <code>eigenmethods</code> is least likely to fail, but it 
does not establish the marginality between the terms. It is often needed 
when there is nonorthogonality between terms, such as when there are several 
linear covariates. It can also be more efficeint in these circumstances.
</p>
<p>The process can be computationally expensive, particularly for a large data set 
(500 or more observations) and/or when many terms are to be orthogonalized. 
</p>
<p>If the error <code>Matrix is not idempotent</code> should occur then, especially 
if there are  many terms, one might try using <code>set.daeTolerance</code> 
to reduce the tolerance used in determining if values are either the same 
or are zero; it may be necessary to lower the tolerance to as low as 0.001. 
Also, setting <code>orthogonalize</code> to <code>eigenmethods</code> is worth a try.
