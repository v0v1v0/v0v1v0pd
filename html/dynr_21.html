autonomous ODE system from the phaseR package written by Michael J. Grayling.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A Function to plot the flow or velocity field for a one or two dimensional 
autonomous ODE system from the phaseR package written by Michael J. Grayling.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dynr.flowField(deriv, xlim, ylim, parameters = NULL, system = "two.dim",
  points = 21, col = "gray", arrow.type = "equal", arrow.head = 0.05,
  frac = 1, add = TRUE, xlab = "x", ylab = "y", state.names = c("x",
  "y"), ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deriv</code></td>
<td>
<p>A function computing the derivative at a point for the ODE system 
to be analysed. For examples see the phaseR package guide.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xlim</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length two setting the lower and upper limits of the variable 
to be plotted on the horizontal axis (usually the first variable returned by the function deriv)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ylim</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length two setting the lower and upper limits of the variable 
to be plotted on the vertical axis (usually the second variable returned by the function deriv)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parameters</code></td>
<td>
<p>Parameters of the ODE system, to be passed to deriv. 
Supplied as a vector; the order of the parameters can be found from the 
deriv file. Defaults to NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>system</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set to either "one.dim" or "two.dim" to indicate the type of system 
being analysed. Defaults to "two.dim".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>points</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the density of the line segments to be plotted. Defaults to 11.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>col</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the color of the plotted line segments. Defaults to "gray". 
Should be a vector of length one. Will be reset accordingly if it is a vector of the wrong length.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arrow.type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the type of line segments plotted. Options include:
"proportional" = the length of the line segments reflects the magnitude of the derivative. 
"equal" the line segments take equal lengths, simply reflecting the gradient of 
the derivative(s). Defaults to "equal".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>arrow.head</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the length of the arrow heads. Passed to arrows. Defaults to 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>frac</code></td>
<td>
<p>Sets the fraction of the theoretical maximum length line segments can take 
without overlapping, that they can actually attain. In practice, frac can be set to greater 
than 1 without line segments overlapping.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Defaults to TRUE.
TRUE = the flow field is added to an existing plot; FALSE = a new plot is created.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xlab</code></td>
<td>
<p>Label for the x-axis of the resulting plot. Defaults to "x".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ylab</code></td>
<td>
<p>Label for the y-axis of the resulting plot. Defaults to "y".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>state.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>State names for ode functions that do not use positional states</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional arguments to be passed to either plot or arrows.</p>
</td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a list with the following components:
add, arrow.head, arrow.type, col, deriv, dx, dy, frac, parameters, points,
system, x, xlab, xlim, y, ylab, ylim. Most of these components correspond simply
to their original input values. 
</p>
<p>The only new elements are:
</p>
<p>dx = A matrix. In the case of a two dimensional system, the values of the 
derivative of the first dependent derivative at all evaluated points.
</p>
<p>dy = A matrix. In the case of a two dimensional system, the values of the derivative of the second dependent variable at all evaluated points. In the case of a one dimensional system, the values of the derivative of the dependent variable at all evaluated points.
</p>
<p>x	= A vector. In the case of a two dimensional system, the values of the first dependent variable at which the derivatives were computed. In the case of a one dimensional system, the values of the independent variable at which the derivatives were computed.
</p>
<p>y	= A vector. In the case of a two dimensional system, the values of the second dependent variable at which the derivatives were computed. In the case of a one dimensional system, the values of the dependent variable at which the derivatives were computed.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The phaseR package was taken off cran as off 10/1/2019 so we are 
exporting some selected functions from phaseR_2.0 published on 8/20/2018.
For details of these functions please see original documentations on the
phaseR package.
