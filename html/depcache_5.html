<h2>Cache R Expressions, Taking Their Dependencies into Account</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Hash an expression with its dependencies and store its
	value, reloading it from a file as long as both the expression and
	its dependencies stay the same.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions in this package take an expression, walk its code to
find its dependencies and calculate a hash of them. If a corresponding
file already exists, it is loaded; otherwise, the expression is
evaluated and its value is saved in the file. Optionally, this check
may be performed every time a variable is accessed.
</p>
<p>By default, a subdirectory of the current directory is used to store
the cache files.
