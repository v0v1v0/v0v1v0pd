<h2>Drug Demand Forecasting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Performs drug demand forecasting by modeling drug
dispensing data while taking into account predicted enrollment
and treatment discontinuation dates. The gap time between
randomization and the first drug dispensing visit is modeled
using interval-censored exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, or
log-normal distributions
(Anderson-Bergman (2017) <a href="https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v081.i12">doi:10.18637/jss.v081.i12</a>).
The number of skipped visits is modeled using Poisson,
zero-inflated Poisson, or negative binomial distributions
(Zeileis, Kleiber &amp; Jackman (2008) <a href="https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v027.i08">doi:10.18637/jss.v027.i08</a>).
The gap time between two consecutive drug dispensing visits
given the number of skipped visits is modeled using linear
regression based on least squares or least absolute
deviations (Birkes &amp; Dodge (1993, ISBN:0-471-56881-3)).
The number of dispensed doses is modeled using linear
or linear mixed-effects models
(McCulloch &amp; Searle (2001, ISBN:0-471-19364-X)).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In clinical trials, patients do not always follow
protocol-specified visit and drug dispensing schedules.
Patients may encounter delays in their drug dispensing
appointments, skip visits altogether, or receive doses
different from the protocol-specified target.
Relying solely on protocol-based predictions tends to result
in an overestimation of drug demand. Consequently, we propose
a method that models observed drug dispensing data,
thereby accounting for these deviations.

<ul>
<li> <p><code>k0</code>: The number of skipped visits between randomization
and the first drug dispensing visit.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>t0</code>: The gap time between randomization and the first
drug dispensing visit when there is no visit skipping.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>t1</code>: The gap time between randomization and the first
drug dispensing visit when there is visit skipping.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ki</code>: The number of skipped visits between two consecutive
drug dispensing visits.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ti</code>: The gap time between two consecutive drug
dispensing visits.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>di</code>: The dispensed doses at drug dispensing visits.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For <code>k0</code> and <code>ki</code>, we explore several modeling options,
including constant, Poisson, zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and
negative binomial distributions.
</p>
<p>For <code>t0</code>, we consider various models such as constant,
exponential, Weibull, log-logistic, and log-normal.
</p>
<p>For <code>t1</code> (given <code>k0</code>) and <code>ti</code> (given <code>ki</code>),
we apply linear regression models using least squares or
least absolute deviations.
</p>
<p>For <code>di</code>, we evaluate constant, linear, and linear
mixed-effects models with subject random effects.
</p>
<p>Once the dosing models are fitted to the observed drug
dispensing data, we draw model parameters from their
approximate posterior distributions. Subsequently, we simulate
drug dispensing data after cutoff for both ongoing and new patients.
</p>
<p>Finally, we estimate the dose to dispense based on the
simulated data.
