<h2>Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) algorithm with constant nearest neighbor parameter</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to calculate Local Correlation Integral (LOCI) as an outlier score for observations. Suggested by Papadimitriou, S., Gibbons, P. B., &amp; Faloutsos, C. (2003). Uses a k number of nearest neighbors instead of a constant radius</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">LOCI(dataset, alpha = 0.5, nn = 20, k = 3)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dataset</code></td>
<td>
<p>The dataset for which observations have a LOCI returned</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>The parameter setting the size of the sampling neighborhood, as a proportion of the counting neighborhood, for observations to identify other observations in their respective neighborhood. An alpha of 1 equals a sampling neighborhood the size of the counting neighborhood (the size of distance to nn). An alpha of 0.5 equals a sampling neighborhood half the size of the counting neighborhood</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nn</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of nearest neighbors to compare sampling neighborhood with. Original paper suggest a constant user-given radius that includes at least 20 neighbors in order to introduce statistical errors in MDEF. Default is 20</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>k</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of standard deviations the sampling neighborhood of an observation should differ from the sampling neighborhood of neighboring observations, to be an outlier. Default is set to 3 as used in original papers experiments</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>LOCI computes a counting neighborhood to the nn nearest observations, where the radius is equal to the outermost observation. Within the counting neighborhood each observation has a sampling neighborhood of which the size is determined by the alpha input parameter. LOCI returns an outlier score based on the standard deviation of the sampling neighborhood, called the multi-granularity deviation factor (MDEF). The LOCI function is useful for outlier detection in clustering and other multidimensional domains</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npar_pi</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the number of observations within the sample neighborhood for observations</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>avg_npar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of average number of observations within the sample neighborhood for neighboring observations</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sd_npar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of standard deviations for observations sample neighborhood</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>MDEF</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of the multi-granularity deviation factor (MDEF) for observations. The greater the MDEF, the greater the outlierness</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>norm_MDEF</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of normalized MDEF-values, being sd_npar/avg_npar</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>class</code></td>
<td>
<p>Classification of observations as inliers/outliers following the rule of k</p>
</td>
</tr>
