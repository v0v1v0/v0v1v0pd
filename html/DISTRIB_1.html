<h2>
Four Essential Functions for Statistical Distributions Analysis: A New Functional Approach
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Previously, four useful functions <code>dnorm</code>, <code>pnorm</code>, <code>qnorm</code> and <code>rnorm</code> are introduced for any univariate distribution in package <code>stats</code>. 
But the name of these functions are different for any distribution, for example compare the names of <code>dcauchy</code> and <code>dchisq</code> which are for Cauchy and Chi-square distributions, respectively.
Now suppose that you have a fixed formula which you want to work with any distribution. To this matter, the author of this package try to define four functions <code>pdf</code>, <code>cdf</code>, <code>rd</code> and <code>q</code> in package <code>DISTRIB</code>, in which the user is able to consider the name of distribution as a argument of them, and therefore these functions can work with any arbitrary distribution.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># An applied example for computing p-value in testing H0: mu&gt;=0, vs, H1: mu&lt;0 with two 
# different test statistic distribution: 

# (a) where the statistics test is T~N(0,1) and its observed value is t = -1.5
p_value = cdf(T.dist="norm", T.dist.par=c(0,1), t=-1.5)
print(p_value)

# (b) where the statistics test T has t-student dist. with 10 degree of freedom 
#     and its observed value is t = -1.5
p_value = cdf(T.dist="t", T.dist.par=10, t=-1.5) 
print(p_value)
