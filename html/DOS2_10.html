<h2>
Expand a Distance Matrix for Matching with Fine Balance.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In optimal pair matching with fine balance, expand a distance matrix to become a square matrix to enforce fine balance.  The method is discussed in Chapter 11 of "Design of Observational Studies", second edition, and it is conceptually the simplest way to implement fine balance; therefore, it remains very useful for teaching and for self-study.  See details.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">fine(dmat, z, f, mult = 100)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dmat</code></td>
<td>

<p>A distance matrix with one row for each treated individual and one column for each control.  Often, this is either the Mahalanobis distance based on covariates, 'mahal', or else a robust variant produced by 'smahal'.  The distance matrix dmat may have been penalized by 'addalmostexact' or 'addcaliper'.  An error will result unless dmat has more columns than rows.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>z is a vector that is 1 for a treated individual and 0 for a control.  The number of treated subjects, sum(z), must equal the number of rows of dmat, and the number of potential controls, sum(1-z), must equal the number of columns of dmat.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>

<p>A factor or vector to be finely balanced.  Must have length(f)=length(z).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mult</code></td>
<td>

<p>A positive number, mult&gt;0.  Determines the penalty used to enforce fine balance as max(dmat)*mult.  The distance matrix dmat may have been penalized by 'addalmostexact' or 'addcaliper', and in this case it makes sense to set mult=1 or mult=2, rather than the default, mult=100.  If dmat is already penalized, taking mult&gt;1 creates a larger penalty for deviations from fine balance than the exisiting penalties.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The method is discussed in Chapter 11 of "Design of Observational Studies", second edition, and it is conceptually the simplest way to implement fine balance.  However, the expanded distance matrix can become quite large, so this simplest method is not the most efficient method in its use of computer storage.  A more compact implementation uses minimum cost flow in a network (Rosenbaum 1989, Section 3.2).  Additionally, there are several extensions of fine balance, including near-fine balance (Yang et al. 2012, in Yu's 'DiPs' package), fine balance for several covariates via integer programming (Zubizarreta 2012, 'designmatch' R-package), and refined balance (Pimentel et al. 2015, 'rcbalance' R-package).  Ruoqi Yu's 'bigmatch' R-package implements fine balance and near-fine balance in very large matching problems.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An expanded, square distance matrix with "extra" treated units for use in optimal pair matching.  Any control paired with an "extra" treated unit is discarded, as are the "extra" treated units.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Fine balance is discussed in chapter 11 of "Design of Observational Studie", second edition.
</p>
<p>The matching functions in the 'DOS2' package are aids to instruction or self-instruction while reading "Design of Observational Studies".  As in the book, these functions break the task of matching into small steps so they are easy to understand in depth. In practice, matching entails a fair amount of book-keeping best done by a package that automates these tasks.  For fine balance and similar methods, use
R packages 'rcbalance', 'DiPs', 'designmatch' or 'bigmatch'.  Section 14.10 of "Design of Observational Studies", second edition, discusses and compares several R packages for optimal matching.
