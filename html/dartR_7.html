<h2>Assign an individual of unknown provenance to population based on 
Mahalanobis Distance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This script assigns an individual of unknown provenance to one or more target
populations based on the unknown individual's proximity to population 
centroids; proximity is estimated using Mahalanobis Distance. 
</p>
<p>The following process is followed:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p> An ordination is undertaken on the populations to again yield a
series of orthogonal (independent) axes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> A workable subset of dimensions is chosen, that specified, or
equal to the number of dimensions with substantive eigenvalues, whichever is
the smaller.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The Mahalobalis Distance is calculated for the unknown against each
population and probability of membership of each population is calculated.
The assignment probabilities are listed in support of a decision.
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are three considerations to assignment. First, consider only those
populations for which the unknown has no private alleles. Private alleles are
an indication that the unknown does not belong to a target population
(provided that the sample size is adequate, say &gt;=10). This can be evaluated
with gl.assign.pa().
</p>
<p>A next step is to consider the PCoA plot for populations where no private
alleles have been detected. The position of the unknown in relation to the
confidence ellipses is plotted by this script as a basis for narrowing down
the list of putative source populations. This can be evaluated with 
gl.assign.pca().
</p>
<p>The third step (delivered by this script) is to consider the assignment 
probabilities based on the squared Generalised Linear Distance 
(Mahalanobis distance) of the unknown from the centroid for each population, 
then to consider the probability associated with its quantile using the 
Chisquare approximation. In effect, this index takes into account position 
of the unknown in relation to the confidence envelope in all selected 
dimensions of the ordination. The larger the assignment probability, 
the greater the confidence in the assignment. 
</p>
<p>If dim.limit is set to 2, to correspond with the dimensions used in
gl.assign.pa(), then the output provides a ranking of the final set
of putative source populations.
</p>
<p>If dim.limit is set to be &gt; 2, then this script provides a basis for
further narrowing the set of putative populations.If the unknown individual
is an extreme outlier, say at less than 0.001 probability of population 
membership (0.999 confidence envelope), then the associated population 
can be eliminated from further consideration.
</p>
<p>Warning: gl.assign.mahal() treats each specified dimension equally, without
regard to the percentage variation explained after ordination. If the 
unknown is an outlier in a lower dimension with an explanatory variance of,
say, 0.1
dimensions from the ordination.
</p>
<p>Each of these above approaches provides evidence, none are 100
They need to be interpreted cautiously.
</p>
<p>In deciding the assignment, the script considers an individual to be an
outlier with respect to a particular population at alpha = 0.001 as default
