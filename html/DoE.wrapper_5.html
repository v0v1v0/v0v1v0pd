<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Brief description of the statistical background of 
central composite designs 
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Central composite designs (ccd's) were invented by Box and Wilson (1951) 
for response surface experimentation with quantitative factors. 
They are used for estimation of second order 
response surface models, i.e. models that allow to estimate linear, quadratic and 
interaction effects for all factors. 
</p>
<p>Central composite designs consist of a cube and star points (also called 
axial points). Both the cube and the star portion of the design should have some center 
points. The cube is a (fractional) factorial design and should be at least of resolution V. 
The line between the center points and the star points intersects the faces of the cube 
in their middle (see the link to the NIST/Sematech e-Handbook 
for a visualization). There are two star points per factor, i.e. the number of runs 
for (each block of) the star 
portion of the design is twice the number of factors plus the number of center points 
in the star portion. 
</p>
<p>The tuning parameter <code>alpha</code> determines whether the star points lie on the 
faces of the cube (<code>alpha=1</code>, face-centered), inside the cube (<code>alpha&lt;1</code>, 
inscribed) or outside the cube (<code>alpha&gt;1</code>, circumscribed). 
The latter case is the usual one. The value of 
<code>alpha</code> can be chosen such that the design is rotatable (may be useful if the scales 
of the factors are comparable) or such that the design is orthogonally blocked 
(i.e. the block effects do not affect the effect estimates of interest). The default 
is to generate orthogonally blocked designs.
</p>
<p>Central composite designs are particularly useful in sequential experimentation, 
where a (fractional) factorial with center points is followed up by a star portion 
of the design. While the cube can already estimate the linear and interaction effects, 
the center points can only estimate the sum of all quadratic effects. If this indicates 
that quadratic effects are important, a star portion can be added in order to investigate 
the model more deeply.
