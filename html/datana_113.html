<h2>Contains information of Camera trap data on medium to large terrestrial mammals 
collected at 54 camera stations in Ruaha National Park, southern Tanzania.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Dataset contains 14604 observations and sampling was carried out for two months during the
dry season of 2013 and two months during the wet season of 2014. Each camera station is associated
with a randomly placed camera and a trail-based camer, with the aim of comparing communities 
resulting from the two camera trap placement strategies.
