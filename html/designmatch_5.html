<h2>
Optimal Matched Design of Randomized Experiments and Observational Studies
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>designmatch</code> includes two functions for the construction of matched samples that are balanced and representative by design.  These two functions are <code>bmatch</code> and <code>nmatch</code> for bipartite and nonbipartite matching, respectively.  Both functions include options for directly balancing means, higher order moments, and distributions of the observed covariates.  In both <code>bmatch</code> and <code>nmatch</code>, an integer programming (IP) problem is solved.  This IP problem either minimizes the total sum of covariate distances between matched units, maximizes the total number of matched units, or optimizes a combination of the two, subject to matching and covariate balancing constraints.  In order to solve these problems, four different optimization solvers can be used: CPLEX, GLPK, Gurobi, HiGHS, and Symphony.  By default, both <code>bmatch</code> and <code>nmatch</code> solve a relaxation of these integer programs using HiGHS, which runs quickly but may violate to some extent some of the balancing constraints.  If the user wants to solve for an exact solution of the program, we strongly recommend using either CPLEX or Gurobi, which are much faster but require a license (free for academic users) and special installation (see the installation instructions).  Between the two, Gurobi is considerably easier to install.  Among others, <code>designmatch</code> can be used for matching in treatment-control as well as case-control observational studies; observational studies with instrumental variables and discontinuity designs; and for the design of randomized experiments, for example for matching before randomization.  The package also includes functions for assessing covariate balance in the matched samples.
