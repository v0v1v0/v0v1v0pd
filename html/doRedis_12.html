<h2>Remove a doRedis queue and delete all associated keys from Redis.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Removing a doRedis queue cleans up associated keys in the Redis
database and signals to workers listening on the queue to terminate.
Workers terminate after their timeout period after their work
queue is deleted.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">removeQueue(queue)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>queue</code></td>
<td>
<p>the doRedis queue name</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>NULL</code> is invisibly returned; this function is called for the side effect of removing
Redis keys associated with the specified queue.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Workers listening for work on more than one queue will only
terminate after all their queues have been deleted. See <code>registerDoRedis</code>
for an example.
