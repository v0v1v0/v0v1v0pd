<h3>Source</h3>

<p>Data from Table No. 1, page 116, of Chapman (1928). Series of experiments under controlled
conditions in which flour beetles (Tribolium confusum) are kept in environments of known size. 
The period from egg to adult is approximately forty days at 27C degrees. The data were entered by
Yamara Arancibia, a former student of Prof. Christian Salas-Eljatib.
