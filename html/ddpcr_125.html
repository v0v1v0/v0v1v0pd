<h2>Analysis step: Remove failed wells</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Check if any wells have failed the ddPCR experiment by checking a series
of quality control metrics.  If any well is deemed as a failure, all the droplets
in that well will be assigned to the <em>FAILED</em> cluster.<br><br><a href="https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr#advanced-topic-2-algorithms-used-in-each-step">See the README</a> for
more information about the algorithm used to find failed wells.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">remove_failures(plate)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plate</code></td>
<td>
<p>A ddPCR plate.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function is recommended to be run as part of an analysis pipeline (ie.
within the <code>analyze</code> function) rather than being called
directly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ddPCR plate with the droplets in failed wells marked as failed. The plate's
metadata will have a new variable <code>success</code> which will be <code>FALSE</code>
for any failed well and <code>TRUE</code> for all others.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This is an S3 generic, which means that different ddPCR plate types can
implement this function differently.
<a href="https://github.com/daattali/ddpcr#advanced-topic-3-creating-new-plate-types">See the README</a> for
more information on how to implement custom ddPCR plate types.
