<h2>Representation of a mass function in a product space</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is used to represent a relation between two or more variables in their product space <code>P</code>. The relation can be described by more than one subset of <code>P</code>. Each subset can also  include more than one element. Complete disjunctive coding is used to represent one element in the input matrix of the function.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bcaRel(
  tt,
  spec,
  infovar,
  varnames,
  valuenames,
  relnb = NULL,
  infovarnames,
  infovaluenames
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The description matrix of the subsets establishing the relation. This matrix is obtained by putting the variables side by side, as in a truth table representation. For each variable, there are as many columns as possible values. Each row of the matrix is an element of a subset. Each element is described by a sequence of 0 (absence of value of a variable) or 1 (presence of value). This forms a complete disjunctive coding. CAUTION: Variables put side by side must be ordered by their *idvar* from left to right.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>spec</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two column matrix. First column: numbers assigned to the sub-assemblies. Second column: the mass values of the sub-assemblies. If the subset has more than one element, the number of the subset and its associated mass value are repeated to match the number of elements in the subset.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>infovar</code></td>
<td>
<p>A two column matrix containing variable identification numbers and the number of elements of each variable. The identification numbers must be ordered in increasing number.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>varnames</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the variables.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>valuenames</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of the names of the variables with the name of the elements of their frame of discernment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>relnb</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number given to the relation. Set at 0 if omitted.</p>
</td>

<p>Deprecated. Old name for <code>varnames</code>.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>bcaspec</code> called a bca for "basic chance assignment". This is a list containing the following components:  </p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> con The measure of conflict.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> tt The resulting table of subsets. Rownames of the matrix of subsets are generated from the column names of the elements of the product frame. See <code>nameRows</code> for details.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> spec The resulting two-column matrix of specification numbers with associated mass values.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> infovar The two-column matrix of variables number and size given in the input data.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> valuenames A list of the names of the variables with the name of the elements of their frame of discernment.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> inforel A two-column matrix containing the relation number and the depth (number of variables) of the relation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># A logical implication rule
# A typical relation between two variables is the
# logical implication a -&gt; b. Let us suppose
# that a stands for Rain: {yes, no} and b stands for
# Roadworks: {yes, no}. From experience,
# I am 75 % sure that there will be RoadWorks if there is no rain.

 # 1. The tt table of the logical implication
 ttrwf &lt;- matrix(c(0,1,1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1),
 nrow = 4, byrow = TRUE, 
 dimnames = list(NULL, c("rWdy", "rWdn", "Ry", "Rn")) )
 
 # 2. The mass distribution
 specrw &lt;-  matrix(c(1,1,1,2,0.75,0.75,0.75,0.25), ncol = 2, 
 dimnames = list(NULL, c("specnb", "mass")))
  
 # 3. Variables numbers and sizes
