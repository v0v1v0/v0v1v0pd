<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Our aim is to determine the sample size based on the hazard rates for median survival times between
control drug and test drug. Since, the hazard function is constant for an exponential distribution, the
median survival time is determined by the hazard function. Moreover, comparing the hazard rates between
the treatment drugs is our hypothesis of interest.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>expsize returns a sample size for control and test drug intervention.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# (a) Test for equality:

# The exponential assumption is used to determine the  sample size with  null hypothesis
# that the hazard rates of a test drug and a reference drug are equal i.e.type ="equal".
# The both sample sizes are taken to be equal (k = 1). The  hazard rate of  control drug
# is lambda1 = 2 and that of test drug is  lambda2 = 1. The standard deviation (s.d.) in
# hazard rate due to using control drug &amp; test drug is 0.97 and 3.94 respectively. Their
# combined standard deviation is sigma.lambda = 2.56. The level of significance is alpha
# = 0.05 and the probability of type-II error is beta = 0.20.


expsize(type = "equal", k = 1, delta = 0, lambda1 = 2, lambda2 = 1, sigma1 = 0.97,
        sigma2 = 3.94, sigma.lambda = 2.56, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20)


# (b) Test for noninferiority/superiority:

# The exponential assumption is used to determine sample size by testing null hypothesis
# (type = "noninf.sup") that the difference  between the hazard rates of a test drug and
# the reference drug is less than or equal to a superiority margin delta = 0.2,where k=1
# indicates both the sample  sizes are taken to be equal. The hazard rate of the control
# drug is lambda1 = 2 and  that of test drug is  lambda2 = 1. The standard  deviation in
# hazard rate due to using control drug &amp; test drug is 0.97 and 3.94 respectively. Their
# combined standard deviation is sigma, lambda =2.56. The level of significance is alpha
# = 0.05 and the probability of type-II error is beta = 0.20.

        sigma2 = 3.94, sigma.lambda = 2.56, alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.20)


 # (c) Test for equivalence:

# The exponential assumption is used to determine sample size by testing null hypothesis
# (type = "equiv") that the absolute difference between the hazard rates of a  test drug
# and a ref drug is greater than or equal to a superiority margin delta =0.5, where k =1
# indicates both the sample  sizes are taken to be equal. The hazard rate of the control
# drug is lambda1 = 2 and  that of test drug is  lambda2 = 1.  The standard deviation in
# the hazard rate  due to using control drug and test drug is 0.97 and 3.94 respectively.
# Their combined standard deviation is sigma.lambda = 2.56. The level of significance is
#  alpha = 0.05 and the probability of type-IIqerror is beta = 0.20.
