<h2>Release package to CRAN.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Run automated and manual tests, then post package to CRAN.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">release(pkg = ".", check = FALSE, args = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pkg</code></td>
<td>
<p>The package to use, can be a file path to the package or a
package object.  See <code>as.package()</code> for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>check</code></td>
<td>
<p>if <code>TRUE</code>, run checking, otherwise omit it.  This
is useful if you've just checked your package and you're ready to
release it.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>args</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional character vector of additional command
line arguments to be passed to <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠R CMD build⁠</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package release process will:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Confirm that the package passes <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠R CMD check⁠</code> on relevant platforms
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Confirm that important files are up-to-date
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Build the package
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Submit the package to CRAN, using comments in "cran-comments.md"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add arbitrary extra questions by defining an (un-exported) function
called <code>release_questions()</code> that returns a character vector
of additional questions to ask.
</p>
<p>You also need to read the CRAN repository policy at
'https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/policies.html' and make
sure you're in line with the policies. <code>release</code> tries to automate as
many of polices as possible, but it's impossible to be completely
comprehensive, and they do change in between releases of devtools.

tasks that you can use in addition to or in place of <code>release</code>.
