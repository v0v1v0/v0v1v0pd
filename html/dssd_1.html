<h2>Distance Sampling Survey Design (dssd)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Creates survey designs for distance sampling surveys. These
designs can be assessed for various effort and coverage statistics.
Once the user is satisfied with the design characteristics they can
generate a set of transects to use in their distance sampling survey.
Many of the designs implemented in this R package were first made
available in our 'Distance' for Windows software and are detailed in
Chapter 7 of Advanced Distance Sampling, Buckland et. al. (2008,
ISBN-13: 978-0199225873).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The main functions in this package are: make.region, make.design, generate.transects and run.coverage. See also write.transects for examples of how to export surveys generated by dssd.
</p>
<p>Further information on distance sampling methods and example code is available at <a href="http://distancesampling.org/R/">http://distancesampling.org/R/</a>.
