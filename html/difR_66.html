<h2>Verbal Aggression Data Set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Verbal Aggression data set comes from Vansteelandt (2000) and is made of the responses of 316 subjects (243 women 
and 73 men) to a questionnaire of 24 items, about verbal aggression. All items describe a frustrating situation together 
with a verbal aggression response. A correct answer responses is coded as 0 and 1, a value of one meaning that the subject 
would (want to) respond to the frustrating situation in an aggressive way. In addition, the <em>Trait Anger</em> score (Spielberger, 1988) 
was computed for each subject.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The <code>verbal</code> matrix consists of 316 rows (one per subject) and 26 columns. 
</p>
<p>The first 24 columns hold the responses to the dichotomously scored items. The 25th column holds the trait anger score for each subject. 
The 26th column is vector of the group membership; values 0 and 1 refer to women and men, respectively.
</p>
<p>Each item name starts with <code>S</code> followed by a value between 1 and 4, referring to one of the situations below:
</p>
<p><em>S1</em>: A bus fails to stop for me.
</p>
<p><em>S2</em>: I miss a train because a clerk gave me faulty information.
</p>
<p><em>S3</em>: The grocery store closes just as I am about to enter.
</p>
<p><em>S4</em>: The operator disconnects me when I had used up my last 10 cents for a call.
</p>
<p>The second part of the name is either <em>Want</em> or <em>Do</em>, and indicates whether the subject wanted to respond to the situation or actually did respond. 
</p>
<p>The third part of the name is one of the possible aggressive responses, either <em>Curse</em>, <em>Scold</em> or <em>Shout</em>.
</p>
<p>For example, item <code>S1WantShout</code> refers to the sentence: "a bus fails to stop for me. I want to shout". The corresponding
item response is 1 if the subject agrees with that sentence, and 0 if not.
