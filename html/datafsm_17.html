<h2>Use a Genetic Algorithm to Estimate a Finite-state Machine Model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>evolve_model</code> uses a genetic algorithm to estimate a finite-state
machine model, primarily for understanding and predicting decision-making.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">evolve_model(data, test_data = NULL, drop_nzv = FALSE,
        measure = c("accuracy", "sens", "spec", "ppv"),
        states = NULL, cv = FALSE, max_states = NULL, k = 2,
        actions = NULL, seed = NULL, popSize = 75,
        pcrossover = 0.8, pmutation = 0.1, maxiter = 50,
        run = 25, parallel = FALSE, priors = NULL,
        verbose = TRUE, return_best = TRUE, ntimes = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>A <code>data.frame</code> that has columns named "period" and "outcome"
(period is the time period that the outcome action was taken), and one to
three additional columns, containing predictors.
All of the 3-5 columns should be named.
The period and outcome columns should be integer vectors and the columns
with the predictor variable data should be logical vectors
(<code>TRUE, FALSE</code>).
If the predictor variable data is not  logical, it will coerced to logical
with <br><code>base::as.logical()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>test_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional <code>data.frame</code> that has "period" and "outcome"
columns, with one to three additional columns containing predictors.
All of the (3-5 columns) should be named. The outcome variable is the
decision the decision-maker took for that period.
This <code>data.frame</code> should be in the same format and have the same order
of columns as the data.frame passed to the required <code>data</code> argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drop_nzv</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional logical vector length one specifying whether
predictors variables with variance in provided data near zero should be
dropped before model building. Default is <code>FALSE</code>. See
<code>caret::nearZeroVar()</code>, which calls:<br><code>caret::nzv()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measure</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional length one character vector that is either:
"accuracy", "sens", "spec", or "ppv". This specifies what measure of
predictive performance to use for training and evaluating the model. The
default measure is <code>"accuracy"</code>. However, accuracy can be a problematic
measure when the classes are imbalanced in the samples, i.e. if a class the
model is trying to predict is very rare. Alternatives to accuracy are
available that illuminate different aspects of predictive power. Sensitivity
answers the question, “ given that a result is truly an event, what is the
probability that the model will predict an event?” Specificity answers the
question, “given that a result is truly not an event, what is the
probability that the model will predict a negative?” Positive predictive
value answers, “what is the percent of predicted positives that are
actually positive?”</p>

<td><code>states</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional numeric vector with the number of states.
If not provided, will be set to <code>max(data$outcome)</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>cv</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional logical vector length one for whether cross-validation
should be conducted on training data to select optimal number of states.
This can drastically increase computation time because if <code>TRUE</code>, it
will run <code>evolve_model</code> <code>k*max_states</code> times to estimate optimal
value for states. Ties are broken by choosing the smaller number of states.
Default is <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>

<td>
<p>Optional numeric vector length one specifying max number of
iterations for stopping the GA evolution. A larger number will increase the
probability of finding a very good solution but will also increase the
computation time. This is passed to the GA::ga() function of the <strong>GA</strong>
package. <code>maxiter</code> is scaled by how many parameters are in the model:<br><code>maxiter &lt;- maxiter + ((maxiter*(nBits^2)) / maxiter)</code>.</p>
</td>

<p>Optional numeric vector length one specifying max number of
consecutive iterations without improvement in best fitness score for

for Unix-based machines that can fork the processes.</p>

decision models into bits and then provide them. If this is not specified,

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This is the main function of the <strong>datafsm</strong> package. It relies on the
<strong>GA</strong> package for genetic algorithm optimization. <code>evolve_model</code>
takes data on predictors and data on the outcome. It automatically creates a
fitness function that takes the data, an action vector <code>evolve_model</code>
generates, and a state matrix <code>evolve_model</code> generates as input and
returns numeric vector of the same length as the <code>outcome</code>.
<code>evolve_model</code> then computes a fitness score for that potential solution
FSM by comparing it to the provided <code>outcome</code>. This is repeated for every
FSM in the population and then the probability of selection for the next
generation is proportional to the fitness scores. The default is also for the
function to call itself recursively while varying the number of states inside
a cross-validation loop in order to estimate the optimal number of states.
</p>
<p>If parallel is set to TRUE, then these evaluations are distributed across the
available processors of the computer using the <strong>doParallel</strong> package,
otherwise, the evaluations of fitness are conducted sequentially. Because
this fitness function that <code>evolve_model</code> creates must loop through all
the data every time it is evaluated and we need to evaluate many possible
solution FSMs, the fitness function is implemented in C++ so it is very fast.
</p>
<p><code>evolve_model</code> uses a stochastic meta-heuristic optimization routine to
estimate the parameters that define a FSM model. Generalized simulated
annealing, or tabu search could work, but they are more difficult to
parallelize. The current version uses the <strong>GA</strong> package's genetic
algorithm because GAs perform well in rugged search spaces to solve integer
optimization problems, are a natural complement to our binary string
representation of FSMs, and are easily parallelized.
</p>
<p>This function evolves the models on training data and then, if a test set is
provided, uses the best solution to make predictions on test data. Finally,
the function returns the GA object and the decoded version of the best string
in the population. See ga_fsm for the details of the slots
(objects) that this type of object will have.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an S4 object of class ga_fsm. See ga_fsm for the
details of the slots (objects) that this type of object will have and for

execution of <code>evolve_model()</code>, including <code>summary</code>, <code>print</code>,
and <code>plot</code>. Timing measurement is in seconds.
