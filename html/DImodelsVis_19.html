<h2>Grouped ternary diagrams</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The helper function for preparing the underlying data for creating grouped
ternary diagrams where the proportions of the compositional variables
are combined into groups and visualised on a ternary diagram.
These are very useful when we have multiple compositional variables that can
be grouped together by some hierarchical grouping structure. For example, grouping
species in a ecosystem based on the functions they perform, or grouping
political parties based on their national alliances. Grouping variables this
way allows us to reduce the dimensionality of the compositional data and
visualise it. This is akin to looking at a 2-d slice of the high
dimensional simplex. The relative proportions of each variable within a group
can be adjust to look at different slices of the simplex. Looking at multiple
such slices would enable us to create an approximation of how the response varies
across the original n-dimensional simplex. The output of this function can be passed to the
<code>grouped_ternary_plot</code> function to plot the results.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">grouped_ternary_data(
  prop,
  FG,
  values = NULL,
  tern_vars = NULL,
  conditional = NULL,
  add_var = list(),
  resolution = 3,
  prediction = TRUE,
  ...
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prop</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector indicating the model coefficients
corresponding to variable proportions. These variables should
be compositional in nature (i.e., proportions should sum to 1).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>FG</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector specifying the groupings of the variables specified in 'prop'.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>values</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector specifying the proportional split of the variables within a group.
The default is to split the group proportion equally between
each variable in the group.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tern_vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector giving the names of the three variables
to be shown in the ternary diagram.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>conditional</code></td>
<td>
<p>A data-frame describing the names of the compositional variables
and their respective values at which to slice the
simplex space. The format should be, for example, as follows: <br><code>data.frame("p1" = c(0, 0.5), "p2" = c(0.2, 0.1))</code> <br>
One figure would be created for each row in 'conditional' with
the respective values of all specified variables. Any
compositional variables not specified in 'conditional' will
be assumed to be 0.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>add_var</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list or data-frame specifying values for additional variables
in the model other than the proportions (i.e. not part of the
simplex design).
This could be useful for comparing the predictions across
different values for a non-compositional variable.
If specified as a list, it will be expanded to show a plot
for each unique combination of values specified, while if specified
as a data-frame, one plot would be generated for each row in the
data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>resolution</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number between 1 and 10 describing the resolution of the
resultant graph.
A high value would result in a higher definition figure
but at the cost of being computationally expensive.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>prediction</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical value indicating whether to pass the final data
to the 'add_prediction' function and append the
predictions to the data. Default value is <code>TRUE</code>, but
often it would be desirable to make additional changes to
the data before making any predictions, so the user can set this to
<code>FALSE</code> and manually call the 'add_prediction'
function.</p>

<p>Arguments passed on to <code>add_prediction</code>
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>model</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A regression model object which will be used to make predictions
for the observations in 'data'. Will override 'coefficients'
if specified.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>coefficients</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>If a regression model is not available (or can't be fit in R),
the regression coefficients from a model fit in some other
language can be used to calculate predictions. However, the
user would have to ensure there's an appropriate one-to-one
positional mapping between the data columns and the
coefficient values. Further, they would also have to provide
a variance-covariance matrix of the coefficients in the 'vcov'
parameter if they want the associated CI for the prediction or
it would not be possible to calculate confidence/prediction
intervals using this method.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>vcov</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>If regression coefficients are specified, then the variance-covariance
matrix of the coefficients can be specified here to calculate the
associated confidence interval around each prediction. Failure to do
so would result in no confidence intervals being returned. Ensure
'coefficients' and 'vcov' have the same positional mapping with the data.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>coeff_cols</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>If 'coefficients' are specified and a one-to-one positional
mapping between the data-columns and coefficient vector is
not present. A character string or numeric index can be specified
here to reorder the data columns and match the corresponding
coefficient value to the respective data column. See the
"Use model coefficients for prediction" section in examples.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>conf.level</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The confidence level for calculating confidence/prediction
intervals. Default is 0.95.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>interval</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Type of interval to calculate:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>"none" (default)</dt>
<dd>
<p>No interval to be calculated.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"confidence"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate a confidence interval.</p>
</dd>
<dt>"prediction"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Calculate a prediction interval.</p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(DImodels)

## Load data
data(sim3)

## Fit model
mod &lt;- glm(response ~ 0 + (p1 + p2 + p3 + p4 + p5 + p6 + p7 + p8 + p9)^2,
           data = sim3)

## Create data
## We have nine (p1 to p9) variables here and using \code{\link{conditional_ternary}}
## to visualise the simplex space won't be very helpful as there are too
## variables to condition on
## Instead we group the nine-variables into three groups called "G", "L" and "H"
head(grouped_ternary_data(model = mod,
                          prop = paste0("p", 1:9),
                          FG = c("G","G","G","G","G","L","L","H","H"),
                          resolution = 1))

## By default the variables within a group take up an equal share of the
## group proportion. So for example, each point along the above ternary
## would have a 50:50 split of the variables in the group "L" or "H", thus
## the vertex where "L" is 1, would mean that p6 and p7 are 0.5 each,
## similarly, the vertex "H" is made up of 0.5 of p8 and p9 while the "G"
## vertex is comprised of 0.2 of each of p1, p2, p3, p4, and p5. The concepts
## also extend to points along the edges and interior of the ternary.

## Change the proportional split of species within an FG by using `values`
## `values` takes a numeric vector where the position of each element
## describes the proportion of the corresponding species within the
## corresponding FG
## For examples this vector describes, 2-% each of p1, p2, p3, p4 and p5,
## in G, 0% and 100% of p6 and p7, respectively in G2 and 30% and 70% of
## p8 and p9, respectively in G3.

                          resolution = 1,
                          model = mod))

## Can also add any additional experimental structures
## Notice .add_str_ID in the data
head(grouped_ternary_data(prop = paste0("p", 1:9),
                          FG = c("G","G","G","G","G","L","L","H","H"),
                          add_var = list("treatment" = c("50", "150")),
                          values = vals,
                          model = mod,
                          resolution = 1))

## It could be desirable to take the output of this function and add
## additional variables to the data before making predictions
## Use `prediction = FALSE` to get data without any predictions
