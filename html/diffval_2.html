<h2>The Total Differential Value of a big phytosociological data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given a big phytosociological data set represented as a list, and a partition
of the relevés in that list, this function calculates the respective Total
Differential Value (TDV).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">bigdata_tdv(
  phyto_list,
  p,
  n_rel,
  output_type = "normal",
  parallel = FALSE,
  mc_cores = getOption("mc.cores", 2L)
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>phyto_list</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list. This is a very light representation of what could
be a usual phytosociological table, registering only taxa presences. Each
component should uniquely represent a taxon and should contain a vector (of
numeric values) with the relevé(s) id(s) where that taxon was observed.
Relevé's ids are expected to be represented by consecutive integers,
starting with 1. The components of the list might be named (e.g. using the
taxon name) or empty (decreasing further memory burden). However, for
<code>output_type == "normal"</code> taxa names are useful for output interpretation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>p</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of integer numbers with the partition of the relevés (i.e.,
a k-partition, consisting in a vector with values from 1 to k, with length
equal to the number of relevés in <code>phyto_list</code>, ascribing each relevé to
one of the k groups).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_rel</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of relevés in the <code>phyto_list</code>, obtained e.g.
with <code>length(unique(unlist(phyto_list)))</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>output_type</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character determining the amount of information returned
by the function and also the amount of pre-validations. Possible values are
"normal" (the default) and "fast".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. Should function <code>parallel::mclapply()</code>) be used to
improve computation time by forking? Not available on Windows. Refer to
that function manual for more information. Defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mc_cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cores to be passed to <code>parallel::mclapply()</code> if
<code>parallel = TRUE</code>. See <code>parallel::mclapply()</code> for more information.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function accepts a list (<code>phyto_list</code>) representing a
phytosociological data set, as well as a k-partition of its relevés (<code>p</code>),
returning the corresponding TDV (see <code>tdv()</code> for an explanation
on TDV).
Partition <code>p</code> gives the group to which each relevé is ascribed, by
increasing order of relevé id.
Big phytosociological tables can occupy a significant amount of computer
memory, which mostly relate to the fact that the absences (usually more
frequent than presences) are also recorded in memory. The use of a list,
focusing only on presences, reduces significantly the amount of needed
memory to store all the information that a phytosociological table contains
and also the computation time of TDV, allowing computations for big data
sets.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>output_type = "normal"</code> (the default) pre-validations are done
(which can take some time) and a list is returned, with the following
components (see <code>tdv()</code> for the mathematical notation):
</p>

<dl>
<dt>ifp</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">\frac{a}{b}</code> values for each taxon
in each group, for short called the 'inner frequency of presences'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>ofda</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">\frac{c}{d}</code> values for each
taxon in each group, for short called the 'outer frequency of
differentiating absences'.</p>
</dd>
<dt>e</dt>
<dd>
<p>A vector with the <code class="reqn">e</code> values for each taxon, i.e., the
number of groups containing that taxon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>diffval</dt>
<dd>
<p>A matrix with the <code class="reqn">DiffVal</code> for each taxon.</p>
</dd>
<dt>tdv</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric with the TDV of matrix <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠m_bin,⁠</code> given the partition
<code>p</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If <code>output_type = "fast"</code>, only TDV is returned and no pre-validations are
done.
