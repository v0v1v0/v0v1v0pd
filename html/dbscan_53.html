<h2>Local Outlier Factor Score</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate the Local Outlier Factor (LOF) score for each data point using a
kd-tree to speed up kNN search.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">lof(x, minPts = 5, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data matrix or a dist object.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minPts</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of nearest neighbors used in defining the local
neighborhood of a point (includes the point itself).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>further arguments are passed on to <code>kNN()</code>.
Note: <code>sort</code> cannot be specified here since <code>lof()</code>
uses always <code>sort = TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>LOF compares the local readability density (lrd) of an point to the lrd of
its neighbors. A LOF score of approximately 1 indicates that the lrd around
the point is comparable to the lrd of its neighbors and that the point is
not an outlier. Points that have a substantially lower lrd than their
neighbors are considered outliers and produce scores significantly larger
than 1.
</p>
<p>If a data matrix is specified, then Euclidean distances and fast nearest
neighbor search using a kd-tree is used.
</p>
<p><strong>Note on duplicate points:</strong> If there are more than <code>minPts</code>
duplicates of a point in the data, then LOF the local readability distance
will be 0 resulting in an undefined LOF score of 0/0. We set LOF in this
case to 1 since there is already enough density from the points in the same
location to make them not outliers. The original paper by Breunig et al
(2000) assumes that the points are real duplicates and suggests to remove
the duplicates before computing LOF. If duplicate points are removed first,
then this LOF implementation in <span class="pkg">dbscan</span> behaves like the one described
by Breunig et al.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A numeric vector of length <code>ncol(x)</code> containing LOF values for
all data points.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">set.seed(665544)
n &lt;- 100
x &lt;- cbind(
  x=runif(10, 0, 5) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.4),
  y=runif(10, 0, 5) + rnorm(n, sd = 0.4)
  )

### calculate LOF score with a neighborhood of 3 points
lof &lt;- lof(x, minPts = 3)

### distribution of outlier factors
summary(lof)
hist(lof, breaks = 10, main = "LOF (minPts = 3)")

### plot sorted lof. Looks like outliers start arounf a LOF of 2.
plot(sort(lof), type = "l",  main = "LOF (minPts = 3)",
  xlab = "Points sorted by LOF", ylab = "LOF")

### point size is proportional to LOF and mark points with a LOF &gt; 2
plot(x, pch = ".", main = "LOF (minPts = 3)", asp = 1)
points(x, cex = (lof - 1) * 2, pch = 1, col = "red")
text(x[lof &gt; 2,], labels = round(lof, 1)[lof &gt; 2], pos = 3)
