<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Impute missing genotype calls with values inferred from non-missing ones.

imp_cnd(g, ...)

<td><code>g</code></td>
<td>
<p>genotype matrix, one row per sample, and one column per variant.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A seemingly naive way to impute a missing value is to use the average of all
non-missing  values  per  variant, <code>imp_avg()</code>.   Besides  simplicity,  this
imputation by  average has  the advantage  of approximating  the correlation
among  test  statistics  (i.e.,  Z-scores)  when  the  original  association
analyses  were performed  with missing  values unfilled,  which is  a common
practice.  This naive approach is the defualt for the correlation calculator
<code>cst()</code>.
</p>
<p>An  advanced imputation  approach is  based on  the conditional  expectation
method,  <code>imp_cnd()</code>, that  explores the  relationship between  variants and
borrows  information from  variants other  than the  target one  when making
guesses.  The sample  correlation among variants imputed this  way is closer
to the  true LD, and may  improve power.  However, after  this imupation one
must  re-run  the  association  analyses  with  imputed  variants  to  avoid
inflation in Type I error rates.
