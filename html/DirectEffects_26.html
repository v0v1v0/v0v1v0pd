<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>A formula object that specifies the covariates and
treatment variables (or mediators) in causal ordering from oldest
to newest with each group separated by <code>|</code>. See below for
more details.</p>

<p>A dataframe containing variables referenced by
<code>formula</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>caliper</code></td>
<td>
<p>A scalar denoting the caliper to be used in matching
in the treatment stage (calipers cannot be used for matching on
the mediator). Observations outside of the caliper are dropped.
Calipers are specified in standard deviations of the covariates.
NULL by default (no caliper).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>L</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of matches to use for each unit. Must be a numeric
vector of either length 1 or 2. If length 1, L sets the number of
matches used in both the first stage (matching on mediator) and
in the second stage (matching on treatment). If length 2, the
first element sets the number of matches used in the first stage
(matching on mediator) and the second element sets the number of
matches used in the second stage (matching on treatment) Default
is 5.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>separate_bc</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical indicating whether or not bias
correction regressions should be run separately within levels of
the treatment and mediator. Defaults to <code>TRUE</code>. If
<code>TRUE</code>, any interactions between treatment/mediator and
covariates in the specification should be omitted.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>telescope_match</code> function implements the
two-stage "telescope matching" procedure developed by Blackwell
and Strezhnev (2021).
</p>
<p>The procedure first estimates a demediated outcome using a
combination of matching and a regression bias-correction. The
<code>data.frame</code> passed to <code>data</code> should be in the wide
format so that each row corresponds to a single unit and
treatments and covariates from different time periods appear as
different columns. The <code>formula</code> argument specifies both the
causal ordering of the variables and the regression specifications
for the bias correction. It should be of the form <code>Y ~ X1 |
 A1 | X2 | A2</code>, where <code>Y</code> is the outcome, <code>X1</code> is a
formula of baseline covariates, <code>A1</code> is a single variable
name indicating the binary treatment in the first period,
<code>X2</code> is a formula of covariates in period 2, and <code>A2</code> is
a single variable name indicating treatment in period 2 (which is
also sometimes called the mediator). Note that it is possible to
add more covariate/treatment pairs for additional time periods.
</p>
<p>Under the default <code>separate_bc == TRUE</code>, the function will
match for each treatment/mediator based on the the covariates up to
that point within levels of past treatments (so for <code>A2</code> this
matching finds units with similar values of <code>X1</code> and <code>X2</code>
and the same value of <code>A1</code>). Once this matching is complete,
the function moves backward through treatments and imputes
potential outcomes using matches and bias-correction regressions,
which regress the current imputed potential outcome on the past
covariates, within levels of the treatment history up to the
current period. The functional form comes from the specification in
<code>formula</code>. Controlled direct effects of <code>A1</code> are
estimated for every possible combination of future treatments.
</p>
<p>When <code>separate_bc</code> is <code>FALSE</code>, the bias correction
regressions are not broken out by the treatments/mediators and
those variables are simply included as separate regressors as
specified in <code>formula</code>. In this setting, interactions between
the treatment/mediator and covariates can be added on a selective
basis to the covariate block (<code>X1</code> or <code>X2</code> and so on)
specifications.
</p>
<p>Matching is performed using the <code>Match()</code> routine from the
<code>Matching</code> package. By default, matching is L-to-1 nearest
neighbor with replacement using Mahalanobis distance.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns an object of <code>class</code> <code>tmatch</code>. Contains
the following components
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>call</code>: the matched call.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>formula</code>: formula used to fit the model.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>m_out</code>: list of matching solutions at each time
point. Each member of the list has a 'matches' list giving the
units matched to that unit, a 'donors' list with the units to
which the unit is matched, and a 'tr' vector which is just the
treatment vector being matched.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>K</code>: data.frame of indicating how many times a unit
has been used as a match, directly in each period and indirectly
across periods.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>L</code>: vector of matching ratios used in each period.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>r_out</code>: nested list of regression imputations used in the
bias correction. The first level of the list varies across
different controlled direct effects (different sequences of future
treatments/mediators). Each of these is a list of time periods and
each of these time periods is a list of 'yhat_r_0' and 'yhat_r_1'
that give the regression predictions for the potential outcomes at
that time point when the treatment at that time point is 0 or 1,
respectively, along with 'n_coefs' giving the number of
coefficients estimated in those models.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tau</code>: vector of bias-corrected estimates of average
controlled direct effects for different vectors of future
treatments/mediators.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tau_raw</code>: vector of standard matching estimates of average
controlled direct effects for different vectors of future
treatments/mediators without using bias correction.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tau_se</code>: vector of estimated standard errors for the average
controlled direct effects estimates for different vectors of future
treatments/mediators. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>tau_i</code>: matrix of individuals contributions to the ACDE
estimates (units on rows, different ACDEs on columns). Used for
weighted bootstrap.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>included</code>: logical vector indicating if each row of
<code>data</code> was included in estimating <code>tau</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>effects</code>: data frame where each row describes the
different ACDEs in <code>tau</code>. The <code>active</code> column describes
the which variable's direct effect is being assessed and the rest
of the columns describe the fixed values of the future
treatments/mediators for that ACDE.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>a_names</code>: character vector with the names of the
treatment/mediator variables used in estimation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>caliper</code>: caliper (if any) used in matching to drop
distant observations.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
