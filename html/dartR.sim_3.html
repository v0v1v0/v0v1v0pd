<h2>Simulates emigration between populations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function that allows to exchange individuals of populations within a
genlight object (=simulate emigration between populations).
</p>
<p>There are two ways to specify emigration. If an emi.table is provided (a
square matrix of dimension of the populations that specifies the emigration
from column x to row y), then emigration is deterministic in terms of numbers
of individuals as specified in the table. If perc.mig and emi.m are provided,
then emigration is probabilistic. The number of emigrants is determined by
the population size times the perc.mig and then the population where to
migrate to is taken from the relative probability in the columns of the emi.m
table.
</p>
<p>Be aware if the diagonal is non zero then migration can occur into the same
patch. So most often you want to set the diagonal of the emi.m matrix to
zero. Which individuals is moved is random, but the order is in the order of
populations. It is possible that an individual moves twice within an
emigration call(as there is no check, so an individual moved from population
1 to 2 can move again from population 2 to 3).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gl.sim.emigration(x, perc.mig = NULL, emi.m = NULL, emi.table = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A genlight or list of genlight objects [required].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>perc.mig</code></td>
<td>
<p>Percentage of individuals that migrate
(emigrates = nInd times perc.mig) [default NULL].</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>emi.m</code></td>
<td>
<p>Probabilistic emigration matrix (emigrate from=column to=row)
[default NULL]</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>emi.table</code></td>
<td>
<p>If presented emi.m matrix is ignored. Deterministic
emigration as specified in the matrix (a square matrix of dimension of the
number of populations). e.g. an entry in the 'emi.table[2,1]&lt;- 5' means that
five individuals emigrate from population 1 to population 2 (from=columns and
to=row) [default NULL].</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list or a single [depends on the input] genlight object, where
emigration between population has happened
