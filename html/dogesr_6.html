<h2>Load data for Venetian family types into the environment</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Load <code>family.types</code> into the environment
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("families")
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with every noble family in the republic of Venice, organized as
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Key: family name.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Value: type of family: Estinte, Vecchie, Apostoliche, Evangeliche, Ducali, Nuove, Nuovissime, Soldo; this last name is not standard, and simply describe those who paid to be included into the Maggior Consiglio. This describes how they accessed nobility.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Main design decision here is that this can be used as external index for the type of family.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">library(dogesr)
data("families")

# Which type was the Dandolo family?
family.types[["Dandolo"]]

# Which families bought their way into the nobility
family.types == "Soldo"

# The families that actually "made doge"
unique(data.doges$Family.doge)

# And their types
family.types[unique(data.doges$Family.doge)]

# Families that had either doge or dogaresse
unique( c(data.doges$Family.doge,data.doges$Family.dogaressa))
