<h2>Subset of character trajectories data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Subset: only 5 examples of each considered character. See details.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>Lists with 100 elements. Each element is a time series. Labels included as factor vector.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Quoting the source:
</p>
<p>"Multiple, labelled samples of pen tip trajectories recorded whilst writing individual
characters. All samples are from the same writer, for the purposes of primitive extraction. Only
characters with a single pen-down segment were considered."
</p>
<p>The subset included in <code>CharTraj</code> has only 5 examples of the X velocity for each character. A
vector with labels is also loaded in <code>CharTrajLabels</code>.
</p>
<p>The subset included in <code>CharTrajMV</code> has 5 examples too, but includes tip force as well as X and Y
velocity. Each element of the list is a multivariate series with 3 variables.
</p>
<p>Please note that even though both <code>CharTraj</code> and <code>CharTrajMV</code> have the same series names, the
actual series in each subset are <strong>not</strong> the same, i.e., <code>CharTraj$A.V1</code> is not in
<code>CharTrajMV$A.V1</code>.
