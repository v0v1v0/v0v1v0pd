<h2>Data format for DSM</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Two <code>data.frame</code>s must be provided to <code>dsm</code>. They are referred to as
<code>observation.data</code> and <code>segment.data</code>.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>segment.data</code> table has the sample identifiers which define the
segments, the corresponding effort (line length) expended and the
environmental covariates that will be used to model abundance/density.
<code>observation.data</code> provides a link table between the observations used in
the detection function and the samples (segments), so that we can aggregate
the observations to the segments (i.e., <code>observation.data</code> is a "look-up
table" between the observations and the segments).
</p>
<p><code>observation.data</code> - the observation <code>data.frame</code> must have (at least) the
following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>object</code> unique object identifier
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Sample.Label</code> the identifier for the segment where observation occurred
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>size</code> the size of each observed group (e.g., 1 if all animals occurred
individually)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>distance</code> distance to observation
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One can often also use <code>observation.data</code> to fit a detection function (so
additional columns for detection function covariates are allowed in this
table).
</p>
<p><code>segment.data</code>: the segment <code>data.frame</code> must have (at least) the following
columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>Effort</code> the effort (in terms of length of the segment)
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>Sample.Label</code> identifier for the segment (unique!)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> ??? environmental covariates, for example location (projected latitude
and longitude), and other relevant covariates (sea surface temperature,
foliage type, altitude, bathymetry etc).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Multiple detection functions</h3>

<p>If multiple detection functions are to be used, then a column named <code>ddfobj</code>
must be included in <code>observation.data</code> and <code>segment.data</code>. This lets the
model know which detection function each observation is from. These are
numeric and ordered as the <code>ddf.obj</code> argument to <code>dsm</code>, e.g.,
<code>ddf.obj=list(ship_ddf, aerial_ddf)</code> means ship detections have <code>ddfobj=1</code>
and aerial detections have <code>ddfobj=2</code> in the observation data.
</p>


<h3>Mark-recapture distance sampling models</h3>

<p>When using <code>mrds</code> models that include mark-recapture components (currently
independent observer and trial modes are supported) then the format of the
observation data needs to be checked to ensure that observations are not
duplicated. The <code>observer</code> column is also required in the
<code>observation.data</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><em>Independent observer mode</em> only unique observations (unique object IDs)
are required.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><em>Trial mode</em> only observations made by observer 1 are required.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
