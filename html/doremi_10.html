<h2>Excitation signal generation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>generate.excitation</code> generates a vector of randomly located square pulses
with a given amplitude, duration and spacing between the pulses. A pulse is where the excitation passes from value 0 to value amplitude
for a given duration and then returns back to 0, thus producing a square shape.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generate.excitation(
  amplitude = 1,
  nexc = 1,
  duration = 2,
  deltatf = 0.1,
  tmax = 10,
  minspacing = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>amplitude</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector of values different from 0 indicating the amplitude of the excitation. It should contain as many values
as the number of pulses (nexc). If the elements are less than the number of pulses, the amplitude vector will be "recycled" and the elements from it will be repeated until
all the pulses are covered (for instance, if the number of excitations nexc is 6 and the amplitude vector has two elements, pulses 1,3 and 5 will
have the same amplitude as the first element of the amplitude vector and pulses 2,4 and 6 that of the second element).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nexc</code></td>
<td>
<p>is an integer greater than 0 indicating the number of pulses to generate.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>duration</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a vector of values greater or equal to 0 indicating the duration of each pulse in time units. It should have as many elements as the number of pulses (nexc). If
the elements are less than the number of pulses, the amplitude vector will be "recycled" and the elements from it will be repeated until
all the pulses are covered.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>deltatf</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a value greater than 0 indicating the time step between two consecutive data points.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tmax</code></td>
<td>
<p>is a value greater than 0 indicating the maximum time range of the excitation vector in time units. The time vector generated will go from 0 to tmax.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minspacing</code></td>
<td>
<p>as pulses are generated randomly, minspacing is a value greater than or equal to 0 that indicates minimum spacing between pulses, thus avoiding
overlapping of the pulses in time. A value of 0 indicates that pulses can follow one another.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Used for simulations in the context of the package. Beware that the following condition should apply:
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">tmax &gt;= (duration+minspacing)*nexc</code>
</p>

<p>so that the pulses "fit" in the time lapse defined.
Compared to <code>pulsew</code> from the <code>seewave</code> package, this function can generate pulses of different duration and amplitude.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns two vectors:
</p>
<p>E- vector containing the values of the excitation generated.
</p>
<p>t- vector containing the values of time generated.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">generate.excitation (amplitude = 3,
                     nexc = 6,
                     duration = 2,
                     deltatf = 1,
                     tmax = 200,
                     minspacing = 2)
#Vector of length 201 (deltatf x tmax + 1 as it includes 0 as initial time value)
generate.excitation (amplitude = c(1,10,20),
                     nexc = 3,
                     duration = c(1,2,4),
                     deltatf = 0.5,
                     tmax = 100,
                     minspacing = 10)
