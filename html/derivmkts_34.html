<h2>Compound options</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A compound option is an option for which the
underlying asset is an option. The underlying option (the
option on which there is an option) in turn has an underlying
asset. The definition of a compound option requires specifying
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>whether you have the right to buy or sell an underlying option
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the underlying option (the option upon which there
is an option) is a put or a call
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying
option (strike price <code>kco</code> — the strike on the compound
option)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the price at which you can buy or sell the underlying
asset should you exercise the compound option (strike price
<code>kuo</code> — the strike on the underlying option)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the date at which you have the option to buy or sell the
underlying option (first exercise date, <code>t1</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the date at which the underlying option expires, <code>t2</code>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these possibilities, you can have a call on a call, a put on
a call, a call on a put, and a put on a put. The valuation
procedure require knowing, among other things, the underlying
asset price at which it will be worthwhile to acquire the
underlying option.
</p>
<p>Given the underlying option, there is a parity relationship: If you
buy a call on a call and sell a call on a call, you have acquired
the underlying call by paying the present value of the strike,
<code>kco</code>.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The option price, and optionally, the stock price above or
below which the compound option is exercised. The compound
option functions are not vectorized, but the greeks function
should work, apart from theta.

<p>The compound option formulas are not vectorized.
