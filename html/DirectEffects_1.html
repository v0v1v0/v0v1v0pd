<h2>Balance diagnostics for Telescope Match objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Balance diagnostics for Telescope Match objects
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">balance.tmatch(object, vars, data, comparison = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p>an object of class <code>tmatch</code> – results from a
call to <code>telescope_match</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars</code></td>
<td>
<p>a formula object containing either the treatment or the
mediator as the dependent variable (which denotes whether
first-stage or second-stage balance diagnostics are returned) and
the covariates for which balance diagnostics are requested as the
independent variables. Each covariate or function of covariates
(e.g. higher-order polynomials or interactions) should be
separated by a +.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>the data frame used in the call to
<code>telescope_match</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>comparison</code></td>
<td>
<p>a binary indicator for if the function should
return the balance for the treated group ('1'), for the control
group ('0'), or for overall combined balanced ('NULL', the
default).</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Provides matching balance diagnostics for <code>tmatch</code>
objects returned by <code>telescope_match</code>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns a data frame with the following columns.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> variable: Name of covariate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> before_0: Pre-matching average of the covariate in the
mediator == 0 (if first stage balance) or treatment == 0 (if second
stage balance) condition
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> before_1: Pre-matching average of the covariate in the
mediator == 1 (if first stage balance) or treatment == 1 (if second
stage balance) condition
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> after_0: Post-matching average of the covariate in the
mediator == 0 (if first stage balance) or treatment == 0 (if second
stage balance) condition
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> after_1: Post-matching average of the covariate in the
mediator == 1 (if first stage balance) or treatment == 1 (if second
stage balance) condition
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> before_sd: standard deviation of the outcome (pre-Matching)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> before_diff: Pre-matching covariate difference between
mediator arms (if first stage balance) or treatment arms (if second
stage balance).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> before_std_diff: Pre-matching standardized covariate
difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or
treatment arms (if second stage balance), Equal to Before_Diff/SD.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> after_diff: Post–matching covariate difference between
mediator arms (if first stage balance) or treatment arms (if second
stage balance).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> after_std_diff: Post-matching standardized covariate
difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or
treatment arms (if second stage balance), Equal to Before_Diff/SD.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
