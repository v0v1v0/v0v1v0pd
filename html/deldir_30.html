<h2> Create a list of tiles in a tessellation </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For each point in the set being tessellated produces a list
entry describing the Dirichlet/Voronoi tile containing that
point.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"> tile.list(object,minEdgeLength=NULL,clipp=NULL) </code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>object</code></td>
<td>
<p> An object of class <code>deldir</code> as produced
by the function <code>deldir()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>minEdgeLength</code></td>
<td>

<p>Positive numeric scalar specifying the minimum length that
an edge of a tile may have.  It is used to eliminate edges
that are effectively of zero length, which can cause tiles
to be “invalid”.  This argument defaults to
<code>sqrt(.Machine$double.eps)</code> time the diameter (length
of the diagonal) of the “rectangular window”
associated with the tessellation.  This rectangular window
is available as the <code>rw</code> component of <code>object</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clipp</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object specifying a polygon to which the
tessellation, whose tiles are being determined, should be clipped.
It should consist either of:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> a list containing two components x and y giving the
coordinates of the vertices of a single polygon. The last vertex
should not repeat the first vertex. Or:
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a list of list(x,y) structures giving the coordinates of
the vertices of several polygons.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If this argument is provided then the tiles in the list that
is produced are “clipped” to the polygon specified by
<code>clipp</code>.  Empty tiles (those which do not intersect the
polygon specified by <code>clipp</code>) are omitted.  The clipping
process may subdivide some of the tiles into two or more
discontiguous parts.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with one entry for each of the points in the set being
tessellated, or for each of the tiles that are retained after clipping
if <code>clipp</code> is not <code>NULL</code>.  Each entry is in turn a list
with a number of components.  These components always include:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ptNum</code></td>
<td>
<p>The index of the point in the original sequence of points
that is being tessellated.  Note that if a point is one of a set
of <em>duplicated</em> points then <code>ptNum</code> is the <em>first</em> of the
indices of the points in this set.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pt</code></td>
<td>
<p>The coordinates of the point whose tile is being described.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area</code></td>
<td>
<p>The area of the tile.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If the tile in question has <em>not</em> been subdivided by the
clipping process then the list components also include:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>x</code> coordinates of the vertices of the tile, in
anticlockwise order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>The <code>y</code> coordinates of the vertices of the tile, in
anticlockwise order.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bp</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of logicals indicating whether the tile vertex is a
“real” vertex, or a <em>boundary point</em>, i.e. a point where the
tile edge intersects the boundary of the enclosing rectangle.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>If the tile in question <em>has</em> been subdivided then the list
does not have the foregoing three components but rather has a
component <code>tileParts</code> which is in turn a list of length equal
to the number of parts into which the tile was subdivided.  Each
component of <code>tileParts</code> is yet another list with four
components <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>bp</code> and <code>area</code> as described above
and as are appropriate for the part in question. 
</p>
<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>
<p>The “auxiliary value” or “tag” associated
with the <code>pt</code>; present only if such values were supplied in
the call to <code>deldir()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>

<p>The author expresses sincere thanks to Majid Yazdani who found and
pointed out a serious bug in <code>tile.list</code> in a previous version
(0.0-5) of the <code>deldir</code> package.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>The set of vertices of each tile may be “incomplete”.  Only
vertices which lie within the enclosing rectangle, and “boundary
points” are listed.
</p>
<p>Note that the enclosing rectangle may be specified by the user
in the call to <code>deldir()</code>.
</p>
<p>In contrast to some earlier versions of <code>deldir</code>, the corners
of the enclosing rectangle are now included as vertices of tiles.
I.e. a tile which in fact extends beyond the rectangular window
and contains a corner of that window will have that corner added
to its list of vertices.  Thus the corresponding polygon is the
intersection of the tile with the enclosing rectangle.
