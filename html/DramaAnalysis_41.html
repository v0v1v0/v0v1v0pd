<h2>Active and Passive Presence</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function should be called for a single text. It returns 
a data.frame with one row for each character in the play. The 
data.frame contains 
information about the number of scenes in which a character is actively 
speaking or passively mentions. Please note that the information about
passive presence is derived from coreference resolved texts, which is a
difficult task and not entirely reliable. The plays included in the package
feature manually annotated coreferences (and thus, the presence is calculated on
the basis of very well data).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">presence(drama, passiveOnlyWhenNotActive = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>drama</code></td>
<td>

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>passiveOnlyWhenNotActive</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical. If true (default), passive presence is only 
counted if a character is not actively present in the scene.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>QDHasCharacter, data.frame. Columns <code>actives</code>, <code>passives</code> and 
<code>scenes</code> show the 
absolute number of scenes in which a character is actively/passively present, or the
total number of scenes in the play. The column <code>presence</code> is calculated as 
<code class="reqn">\frac{actives-passives}{scenes}</code>.
