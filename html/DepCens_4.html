<h2>KidneyMimic data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simulated data frame with 200 individuals, distributed in 40 clinics (clusters) with 5 individuals per clinic. Simulated dataset that mimic a kidney result study. In this simulated dataset it is hypothetically suggested the following causes of outcome: event of interest: death due to kidney failure; dependent censoring: if the patient received a transplant; administrative censoring: all other outcomes.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 200 rows and 9 variables:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> ident: Variable that indicates the clinic (cluster) of the patient.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> time: time observed until the occurrence of the outcome.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> event: variable that indicates the occurrence of the event of interest, event=1 if the event of interest occurs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x1: covariate 1, generated from a Uniform Distribution. Can denote, for example, a exam result.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x2: covariate 2, generated from a Binomial Distribution. Can denote, for example, an treatment
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> x3: covariate 3, generated from a Normal Distribution. can denote, for example, an standardized age.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cens: variable that indicates the outcome, cens=1 if the event of interest occurred (death due to kidney failure); cens=2 if the  dependent censoring occurred (patient received a transplant); cens=3 if administrative censoring.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> delta_t: indicator function of the event of interest.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> delta_c: indicator function of the dependent censoring.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
