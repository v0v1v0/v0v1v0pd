<h2>McMaster Attitudes Data Set.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A data set containing information about <em>students</em> commuting to McMaster University. Data were collected
by means of a travel survey in the fall of 2010. Respondents were asked about their mode of
travel to McMaster University, in Hamilton, Canada. They were also asked to respond to a series of attitudinal
statements. The data set contains relevant attributes about the respondents. The format of the table is wide,
with each row representing an individual respondent. These variables were augmented with information from the
2011 Census of Canada and land use information from local sources.
