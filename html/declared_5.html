<h2>Labelled vectors with declared missing values</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The labelled vectors are mainly used to analyse social science data,
and the missing values declaration is an important step in the analysis.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">as.declared(x, ...)

declared(
  x,
  labels = NULL,
  na_values = NULL,
  na_range = NULL,
  label = NULL,
  measurement = NULL,
  llevels = FALSE,
  ...
)

is.declared(x)

anyNAdeclared(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector to label, or a declared labelled vector
(for <code>undeclare</code>)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Other arguments used by various other methods</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>labels</code></td>
<td>
<p>A named vector or <code>NULL</code>. The vector should be the same type
as <code>x</code>. Unlike factors, labels don't need to be exhaustive: only a fraction
of the values might be labelled</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na_values</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of values that should also be considered as missing</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na_range</code></td>
<td>
<p>A numeric vector of length two giving the (inclusive) extents
of the range. Use <code>-Inf</code> and <code>Inf</code> if you want the range to be
open ended</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>
<p>A short, human-readable description of the vector</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>measurement</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional, user specified measurement level</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>llevels</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, when <code>x</code> is a factor only use those levels that have
labels</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>declared</code> objects are very similar to the <code>haven_labelled_spss</code> objects
from package <b>haven</b>. It has exactly the same arguments, but it features
a fundamental difference in the treatment of (declared) missing values.
</p>
<p>In package <b>haven</b>, existing values are treated as if they were missing.
By contrast, in package <b>declared</b> the NA values are treated as if they
were existing values.
</p>
<p>This difference is fundamental and points to an inconsistency in package
<b>haven</b>: while existing values can be identified as missing using the
function <code>is.na()</code>, they are in fact present in the vector and other
packages (most importantly the base ones) do not know these values should be
treated as missing.
</p>
<p>Consequently, the existing values are interpreted as missing only by package
<b>haven</b>. Statistical procedures will use those values as if they were
valid values.
</p>
<p>Package <b>declared</b> approaches the problem in exactly the opposite way:
instead of treating existing values as missing, it treats (certain) NA values
as existing. It does that by storing an attribute containing the indices of
those NA values which are to be treated as declared missing values, and it
refreshes this attribute each time the declared object is changed.
</p>
<p>This is a trade off and has important implications when subsetting datasets:
all declared variables get this attribute refreshed, which consumes some time
depending on the number of variables in the data.
</p>
<p>The generic function <code>as.declared()</code> attempts to coerce only the compatible
types of objects, namely <code>haven_labelled</code> and <code>factor</code>s. Dedicated class
methods can be written for any other type of object, and users are free to
write their own. To end of with a declared object, additional metadata is
needed such as value labels, which values should be treated as missing etc.
</p>
<p>The measurement level is optional and, for the moment, purely aesthetic. It
might however be useful to (automatically) determine if a declared object is
suitable for a certain statistical analysis, for instance regression requires
quantitative variables, while some declared objects are certainly categorical
despite using numbers to denote categories.
</p>
<p>It distinguishes between <code>"categorial"</code> and <code>"quantitative"</code> types of
variables, and additionally recognizes <code>"nominal"</code> and <code>"ordinal"</code> as
categorical, and similarly recognizes <code>"interval"</code>, <code>"ratio"</code>,
<code>"discrete"</code> and <code>"continuous"</code> as quantitative.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>declared()</code> and <code>as.declared()</code> return labelled vector of class
"declared". When applied to a data frame, <code>as.declared()</code> will return a
corresponding data frame with declared variables. <code>is.declared()</code> and
<code>anyNAdeclared</code> return a logical value.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
x &lt;- declared(
    c(1:5, -1),
    labels = c(Good = 1, Bad = 5, DK = -1),
    na_values = -1
)

x

is.na(x)

x &gt; 0

x == -1

# Values are actually placeholder for categories,
# so labels work as if they were factors:
x == "DK"


# when newly added values are already declared as missing,
# they are automatically coerced
c(x, 2, -1)

# switch NAs with their original values
undeclare(x)

as.character(x)

# Returning values instead of categories
as.character(x, values = TRUE)
</code></pre>
