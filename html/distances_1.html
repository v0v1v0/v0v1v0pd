<h2>distances: Tools for Distance Metrics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <code>distances</code> package provides tools for constructing, manipulating
and using distance metrics in R. It calculates distances only as needed
(unlike the standard <code>dist</code> function which derives the
complete distance matrix when called). This saves memory and can increase
speed. The package also includes functions for fast nearest and farthest
neighbor searching.
