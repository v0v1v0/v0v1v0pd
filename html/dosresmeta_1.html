<h2>Multivariate dose-response meta-analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>It consists of a collection of functions to estimate dose-response
relations from summarized dose-response data for both continuous and binary outcomes, and to combine them according to principles of (multivariate) random-effects model.
</p>


<h3>Modeling framework</h3>

<p>Dose-response meta-analysis represents a specific type of meta-analysis. Aim of such analysis is to reconstruct and combine study-specific curves from summarized
dose-response data. Greenland and Longnecker originally developed the methodology in 1992 for pooling associations from epidemiological studies of binary outcomes.
Extensions are currently proposed for other types of outcomes (e.g. continuous) from others study design, such as clinical trials.
</p>
<p>The summarized dose-response data are most often presented in a tabular way, reporting the levels of the exposure (doses) and the corresponding outcome variable.
The latter is usually expressed as contrast to the unexposed or baseline category (referent level). Examples are (log) relative risks, (log) odds ratios,
(log) incidence rate ratios, mean differences, and standardized mean differences. Thus the outcome cannot be regarded as independent and a (co)variance matrix needs
to be provided or approximated from the available data.See <code>covar.smd</code> and <code>covar.logrr</code> for more details.
</p>


<h3>Estimation procedure</h3>

<p>The pooled dose-response association can be estimated using two different approaches. The former consists of a two-stage procedure, where the study-specific trend
are first estimated and then pooled across studies. Assuming <code class="reqn">y_j</code> is the vector of non-referent outcome values in each of <code class="reqn">i = 1, \dots, m</code> studies, and
<code class="reqn">X_i</code> the related matrix of <code class="reqn">p</code> transformations of the exposure (typically <code class="reqn">p = 1, 2</code>), the dose-response model can be written as
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">y_i = X_i\beta_i + \epsilon_i</code>
</p>
<p> with <code class="reqn">S_i</code> = (co)variance of <code class="reqn">\epsilon_i</code> known (available or
reconstructed from the available data).
The <code class="reqn">\beta_i</code> are then combined according to principles of (multivariate) random-effects meta-analytical models
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">\beta_i ~ N ( \beta, V_i + \Psi )</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">V_i</code> and <code class="reqn">\Psi</code> indicate, respectively, the within study (co)variance (obtained in the first stage analysis) and the between study (co)variance.
</p>
<p>The alternative approach, instead, consists of a one-stage (also known as pool-first) procedure. The data are pooled by concatenating the vector <code class="reqn">y_i</code> and
vectors (or matrices) <code class="reqn">X_i</code>. The (multivariate) random effects-model can be written as </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">y_i = X_i\beta + Z_i\eta_i + \epsilon_i</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">\beta</code> represents the fixed-effects parameter, <code class="reqn">\eta_i</code> the vector (or matrix) of unobserved random-effects for thei-th study, and <code class="reqn">Z_i</code> coincides with <code class="reqn">X_i</code>.
The marginal model has a co(variance) matrix equal to <code class="reqn">\Sigma + Z_i\Psi Z_i^top</code>, where <code class="reqn">\Sigma</code> is the block diagonal (co)variance with i-th diagonal block <code class="reqn">S_i</code>.
</p>
<p>The two approaches provide similar results, despite the two-stage procedure may be more stable and faster in terms of convergence. In both the procedures the
aim is to estimate the coefficients <code class="reqn">\beta</code> and, for random-effects models, the components of the between-study (co)variance matrix <code class="reqn">Psi</code>.
Different estimators are implemented in the package. The estimation options available are
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Fixed-effects
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Maximum likelihood (ML)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Restricted maximum likelihood (REML)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Method of moments (currently available only for the two-stage procedure)
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The fixed-effects model is fitted through generalized least squares (GLS), assuming the (co)variance structure, composed by the within-study error only,
as completely known. Among random-effects models, ML and REML approaches provides fit criteria and inferential test derived from likelihood theory, such
as AIC and likelihood ratio test, purticularly useful in a one-stage procedure. Further details on estimation methods are given in the related help pages.

<h3>Functions and data included in the package</h3>

<p>The structure of the package and the internal functions resemble those of the <code>mvmeta</code> package. See <code>mvmeta-package</code> for a general overview.
The main function is <code>dosresmeta</code>, which performs the various models illustrated above. The function returns a list object of class
"<code>dosresmeta</code>" (see <code>dosresmetaObject</code>).
</p>
<p>The estimation is carried out internally through <code>dosresmeta.fit</code>, a wrapper which prepares the data and calls specific estimation functions
for fitting the models, depending on the chosen procedure. For the two-stage procedure, the second part of the analysis is performed using the function <code>mvmeta.fit</code>
while estimators for random-effects models are implemented in the functions <code>dosresmeta.ml</code> and <code>dosresmeta.reml</code> for
(restricted) maximum likelihood. For likelihood-based methods, iterative optimizations algorithms are used for maximizing
the (restricted) likelihood. Fitting parameter options are set by <code>dosresmeta.control</code>.
</p>
<p>Method functions are available for objects of class "<code>dosremeta</code>" (see <code>dosresmetaObject</code> for a complete list). The method <code>summary</code>
produces a list of class "<code>summary.dosremeta</code>" for summarizing the fit of the model and providing additional results. The method function <code>predict</code>
computes predicted values, optionally for a set of new values of the predictors. <code>blup</code> gives the (empirical) best linear unbiased predictions for the unobserved random-effects.
Other default or specific method functions for regression can be used on objects of class "<code>dosremeta</code>", such as <code>logLik</code>, <code>AIC</code> and <code>BIC</code>, among others.
The method function <code>qtest.dosresmeta</code> (producing an object with class of the same name) performs the Cochran Q test for (residual) heterogeneity currently appropriate only for the two-stage approach.
</p>
<p>Printing functions for the objects of classes defined above are also provided. Other functions are used internally in the source code, and not exported in the
namespace. For users interested in getting into details of the package structure, these functions can be displayed using the triple colon (':::') operator.
For instance, dosresmeta:::glsfit displays the code of the function glsfit.
</p>
<p>The package includes the datasets <code>alcohol_crc</code>, <code>alcohol_cvd</code>, <code>ari</code>, and <code>cc_ex</code> as data frames,
which are used in the examples.
