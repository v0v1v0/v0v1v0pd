<h2>Drug Pharmacology parser</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Describes the use, mechanism of action, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics,
and physiological or biochemical effects in the body.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drug_pharmacology()
</code></pre>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a tibble with the following variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>indication</dt>
<dd>
<p>The approved conditions, diseases, or states for which a
drug can safely and effectively be used. An indication is considered to be
FDA-approved when it has any of the following designations: NDA, ANDA, BLA,
or OTC. May also include indications in other countries, such as Canada
(through Health Canada) or in Europe
(through the European Medicines Agency).</p>
</dd>
<dt>pharmacodynamics</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of how the drug modifies or affects
the organism it is being used in. May include effects in the body that are
desired (enzyme or protein targets for example) and undesired
(also known as “side effects”). This is in contrast to pharmacokinetics,
which describes how the body modifies the drug being used.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mechanism_of_action</dt>
<dd>
<p>A component of pharmacodynamics that describes
the biochemical interaction through which a drug produces its intended
effect. May include the exact molecular protein or enzyme targets and/or
a description of the physiological effects produced.</p>
</dd>
<dt>toxicity</dt>
<dd>
<p>Any adverse reaction, or side effect, that may or may not
occur with use of the drug. May be attributed to a number of effects
including: an enhanced therapeutic effect, rare anaphylactic reactions,
interactions with other medications, or unanticipated binding of the
molecule at different sites within the body.</p>
</dd>
<dt>metabolism</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the chemical degradation of the drug
molecule within the body; most commonly by enzymes from the
Cytochrome P450 (CYP) system in the liver.</p>
</dd>
<dt>absorption</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the movement of the drug from the site
of administration into the bloodstream or target tissue. Common
pharmacokinetic metrics used to evaluate absorption include Area Under
the Curve (AUC), bioavailability (F), maximum concentration (Cmax), and
time to maximum concentration (Tmax).</p>
</dd>
<dt>half-life</dt>
<dd>
<p>The period of time it takes for the amount of drug in the
body to be reduced by one half. Provides a description of how quickly the
drug is being eliminated and how much is available in the bloodstream.</p>
</dd>
<dt>protein-binding	</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the drug’s affinity for plama
proteins and the proportion of the drug that is bound to them when in
circulation within the body.</p>
</dd>
<dt>route_of_elimination</dt>
<dd>
<p>A description of the pathway that is used to
excrete the drug from the body. Common pharmacokinetic parameters used to
evaluate excretion include elimination half life, renal clearance, and
tracking of radiolabelled compounds through the renal and GI system.</p>
</dd>
<dt>volume_of_distribution</dt>
<dd>
<p>The Vd of a drug represents the degree to
which it is distributed into body tissue compared to the plasma.</p>
</dd>
<dt>clearance</dt>
<dd>
<p>A pharmacokinetic measurement of the rate of removal of the
drug from plasma, expressed as mL/min; reflects the rate of elimination of
the drug.</p>
