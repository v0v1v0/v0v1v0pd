<h2>Last occurrences for the K/Pg boundary and a potential influence of Deccan volcanism</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Contains last occurrences generated by a spike in extinction rate at the K/Pg boundary and an influence of Deccan volcanism before that. Relative influence of volcanism ranges from 0% (none), 10 % (weak), 20% (intermediate), 30 % (strong) to 40% (very strong).
Location of Deccan volcanism is based on the extinction interval from Tobin (2017), fig. 5, transformed into time assuming a constant deposition rate.
The last occurrences were generated based on the convolution procedure described in Hohmann (2018) and a rate of fossil occurrences of 40 fossils per Myr.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(KPgLastOccurrences)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with five entries, each named after the intensity of the early extinction pulse described in Hohmann (in preparation). Each of these entries contains three vectors: 'val' contains the last occurrences per Myr at the ages in 'age', and 'parameters' contains the parameters used to create the pattern of last occurrences.
