<h2>Soil treatment experiment in tree seedlings</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A test was made of the effect of three soil treatments on the height 
growth of 2-year-old seedlings. Treatments were assigned at random 
to the three plots within each of 11 blocks. Each plot was made 
up of 50 seedlings.  Average 5-year height growth was the
criterion for evaluating treatments.
