<h2>Colon Cancer Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset describing colon cancer patients. The data is based on real data from a hospital-based cancer registry but many
values are changed to ensure anonymity. Each row is a single case,
while the columns represent patients' health conditions and physical parameters.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("colcancer")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data.frame with 546 observations with colon cancer cases. The 12 columns describe different parameters of patients' conditions.
</p>

<li>
<p> LNE. numeric. The number of examined lymph nodes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> LNR. numeric, ranges from 0 to 1. The number of cancerous lymph nodes divided by the total number (LNE).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> pUICC. factor. Levels: "I", "II", "III", "IV". Pathological cancer stage. The UICC staging system was used.
</p>

</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> R.status factor. Level: "0", "12". Residual tumor after surgery. 0 stands for no residual tumor. 12 stands either for microscopic (R1) or macroscopic residues (R2).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> preexisting.cancer. integer. If there was a history of cancer before the colon cancer. Set to 1 if there has been a cancer in the past and to 0 if not.
