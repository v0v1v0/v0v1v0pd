<h2>Data-driven Haar-Fisz for microarrays</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Takes a matrix containing the resuls of a (e.g.) microarray
experiment (rows are different genes, columns are replicates)
and performs a multiscale variance stabilization and Gaussianization
transform. Note, you have to have replicates to make this work.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">DDHFm(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A matrix containing n rows (genes) and k columns (replicates)</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data-drive Haar-Fisz transform is a multiscale variance
stabilization and Gaussianization transform.
The algorithm will run on a one-column matrix but the results
will NOT be good. For one column of data use some other
variance stabilizer (in which case why are you using one column,
eh?)
</p>
<p>However, if you have replicates then you can use this
powerful multiscale algorithm which will stabilize variance
and also draw the distribution of the intensities towards
Gaussian extremely effectively (so skew and kurtosis will look
good too).
</p>
<p>This function forms a single vector of intensities by the
following procedure. First, it computes the mean over replicates
for each gene (this is why you need replicates, really).
Then it orders the rows of the matrix into increasing mean
order. Then it converts that matrix into a vector (which is therefore
a sequence of intensities which are grouped according to gene
(according to increasing mean intensity within each group)).
Then this vector is padded up to the next power-of-two in length
with zeroes. Then the padded vector is subjected to the
<code>ddhft.np.2</code> function which actually does the
data-driven Haar-Fisz transform. The results of this are
unpadded and then rearranged into a matrix with an identical
structure to the input matrix. This final matrix contains
stabilized and Gaussianized (is this a word?) intensities.
</p>
<p>It is important that you have replicates (ie, the number of
columns of the matrix has to be greater than 1). Also, it
is scientifically important that the replicates be just that
(ie, although the rows might refer to the same genes the columns
must be results from repeats experiments held under identical
conditions). For example, you shouldn't have results for the
gene on one subject and then the same gene on another subject
unless I suppose you are considering them to be replicates in some way.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A single matrix with the same dimensions as the input matrix.
Each entry in the resultant matrix corresponds to a variance
stabilized and Gaussianized version of the entry in the input
matrix.
