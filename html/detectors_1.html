<h2>Predictions from GPT Detectors</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Data derived from the paper <em>GPT detectors are biased against
non-native English writers.</em> The study authors carried out a series of
experiments passing a number of essays to different GPT detection models.
Juxtaposing detector predictions for papers written by native and non-native
English writers, the authors argue that GPT detectors disproportionately
classify real writing from non-native English writers as AI-generated.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">detectors
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 6,185 rows and 9 columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>kind</dt>
<dd>
<p>Whether the essay was written by a <code>"Human"</code> or <code>"AI"</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>.pred_AI</dt>
<dd>
<p>The class probability from the GPT detector that the
inputted text was written by AI.</p>
</dd>
<dt>.pred_class</dt>
<dd>
<p>The uncalibrated class prediction, encoded as
<code>if_else(.pred_AI &gt; .5, "AI", "Human")</code></p>
</dd>
<dt>detector</dt>
<dd>
<p>The name of the detector used to generate the predictions.</p>
</dd>
<dt>native</dt>
<dd>
<p>For essays written by humans, whether the essay was written
by a native English writer or not. These categorizations are coarse;
values of <code>"Yes"</code> may actually be written by people who do not write with
English natively. <code>NA</code> indicates that the text was not written by a human.</p>
</dd>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>
<p>A label for the experiment that the predictions were generated
from.</p>
</dd>
<dt>model</dt>
<dd>
<p>For essays that were written by AI, the name of the model
that generated the essay.</p>
</dd>
<dt>document_id</dt>
<dd>
<p>A unique identifier for the supplied essay. Some
essays were supplied to multiple detectors. Note that some essays
are AI-revised derivatives of others.</p>
</dd>
<dt>prompt</dt>
<dd>
<p>For essays that were written by AI, a descriptor for the
form of "prompt engineering" passed to the model.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
