<h2>
Time-Course Microarray Gene Expression Data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set contains quantile-normalized microarray gene expression measurements of 163 genes from four replicates at 18 time points.  These data are part of the time-course experiment performed on Drosophila with a 5-min pulse of Notch activation (Housden et al. 2013).  The experiment was carried out by Sarah Bray, Ben Housden, Alena Krejci and Bettina Fischer; see details in Housden et al. (2013).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(tc.data)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 163 observations on the 74 variables.  The first two variables are <code>GeneID</code> and <code>GeneName</code>.
</p>
<p>Other variables are log2 fold change of treated cells over control cells for 4 biological replicates at 18 time points.  They are organized as follows: values for replicates 1 through 4 at time 1; values for replicates 1 through 4 at time 2; and so on.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The 18 time points are (in min):
</p>
<p>0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,50,60,70,80,90,100,110,120,150.
</p>
<p>Microarray data have been cleaned and normalized.  Missing values are imputed.  See supplementary material for Fu, Russell, Bray and Tavare for detail on data pre-processing and missing value imputation.
