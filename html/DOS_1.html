<h2>
Use a Penalty to Obtain a Near Exact Match
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A near-exact match (also known as an almost exact match) for a nominal covariate maximizes the number
of pairs that are exactly matched for the nominal covariate.  This is done by adding a large penalty
to the covariate distance between individuals with different values of the nominal covariate.
The topic is discussed in Section 9.2 of Design of Observational Studies (2010).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">addalmostexact(dmat, z, f, mult = 10)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dmat</code></td>
<td>

<p>A distance matrix with one row for each treated individual and one column for each control.  Often, this is either the Mahalanobis distance based on covariates, mahal(), or else a robust variant produced by smahal().
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>z</code></td>
<td>

<p>z is a vector that is 1 for a treated individual and 0 for a control.  length(z) must equal sum(dim(dmat)).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>f</code></td>
<td>

<p>A vector or factor giving the levels of the nominal covariate.  length(f) must equal length(z).
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mult</code></td>
<td>

<p>Let mx be the largest distance in dmat.  Then mult*mx is added to each distance in dmat for which the treated and control individuals have different values of f.  For large enough values of mult, this will ensure that a minimum distance match maximizes the number of individuals who are exactly matched for f.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Very large values of mx may result in numerical instability or slow computations.
</p>
<p>A small value of mx, say 1 or 1/10, may not maximize the number of exactly matched pairs, but it may usefully increase the number of exactly matched pairs.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Returns the penalized distance matrix.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(costa)
z&lt;-1*(costa$welder=="Y")
aa&lt;-1*(costa$race=="A")
smoker=1*(costa$smoker=="Y")
age&lt;-costa$age
x&lt;-cbind(age,aa,smoker)
dmat&lt;-mahal(z,x)
# Mahalanobis distances
round(dmat[,1:6],2)
# Mahalanobis distanced penalized for mismatching on smoking.
dmat&lt;-addalmostexact(dmat, z, smoker, mult = 10)
# The first treated subject (row labeled 27) is a nonsmoker, but the
# third control (column 3) is a smoker, so there is a big penalty.
