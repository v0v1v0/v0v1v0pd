<h2>Calculates the number of missing species to be assigned to each island clade

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates the number of missing species to be assigned to each island clade
in the island_tbl object and assigns the missing species to them. In the case
that multiple genera are in an island clade and each have missing species
the number of missing species is summed. Currently the missing species
are assigned to the genus that first matches with the missing species table,
however a more biologically or stochastic assignment is in development.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_multi_missing_species(missing_species, missing_genus, island_tbl)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_species</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric number of missing species from the phylogeny
that belong to the colonising clade. For a clade with missing species this
is <code class="reqn">n - 1</code>, where <code class="reqn">n</code> is the number of missing species in the clade.
If the clade is an island singleton, the number of missing species is <code>0</code>
because by adding the colonist it already counts as one automatically. If
the clade has more than one species, the <code>missing_species</code> is <code class="reqn">n - 1</code>
because adding the lineage already counts as one.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>missing_genus</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of character vectors containing the genera in
each island clade</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>island_tbl</code></td>
<td>
<p>An instance of the <code>Island_tbl</code> class.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Object of Island_tbl class
