<h2>The peeling algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An implementation of the peeling algorithm based on its description in terms of hypergraphs by R. Almond [1989].<br></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">peeling(vars_def, hgm, hg_rel_names, elim_order, verbose = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vars_def</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of variables and their possible values. Concatenate the valuenames parameter of all the variables of the hypergraph to obtain this list.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hgm</code></td>
<td>
<p>The incidence matrix of the hypergraph (bipartite graph), which is the  description of the relations between the variables. The variables are the nodes of the hypergraph, and the relations are the edges. Each column describes a relation between the variables by a (0,1) vector. A "1" indicates that a variable belongs to the relation and a "0" not. This matrix must have row and column names. These names are used to show the graph eventually. They need not be the same as variables and relations names of the set of bca's to be analyzed. Use short names to obtain a clear graph.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>hg_rel_names</code></td>
<td>
<p>The names of the relations, which are objects of class "bcaspec".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>elim_order</code></td>
<td>
<p>The order of elimination of the variables. A vector of length <code>nrow(hgm)</code>. Variables are identified by numbers. The first number gives the first variable to eliminate. The variable of interest comes last.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>= TRUE: print steps on the console. Default = FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The peeling algorithm works on an undirected graph. Nodes of the graph (variables) are removed one by one until only the variable of interest remains. An order of elimination (peeling) of the variables must be chosen by the user. No algorithm is provided for that matter. At each step, a procedure of extension is applied to the bca's to merge, and marginalization is applied to eliminate a variable. The marginalization has the effect to integrate in the remaining nodes the information of the eliminated variable.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A bca class object.
