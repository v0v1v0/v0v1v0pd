<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The approach developed in Dau et al. (2016) argues that finding a good value of <code>window.size</code> for
the DTW distance is very important, and suggests how to find one by using user-provided feedback.
After clustering is done, a pair of series is presented at a time, and the user must annotate the
pair as:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Must link: the series should be in the same cluster.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Cannot link: the series should <em>not</em> be in the same cluster.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Skip: the choice is unclear.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each step, a good value of the window size is suggested by evaluating which clusterings
fulfill the constraint(s) so far, and how (see Dau et al. (2016) for more information), and
performing a majority vote using the window sizes inferred from each constraint. The (main)
procedure is thus interactive and can be abandoned at any point.
</p>


<h3>Explore</h3>

<p>This part of the app is simply to see some basic characteristics of the provided series and
plot some of them. The field for integer IDs expects a valid R expression that specifies which
of the <code>series</code> should be plotted. Multivariate series are plotted with each variable in a
different facet.
</p>


<h3>Cluster</h3>

<p>This part of the app implements the main procedure by leveraging <code>compare_clusterings()</code>. The
interface is similar to <code>interactive_clustering()</code>, so it's worth checking its documentation
too. Since <code>compare_clusterings()</code> supports parallelization with <code>foreach::foreach()</code>, you can
register a parallel backend before opening the shiny app, but you should pre-load the workers
with the necessary packages and/or functions. See <code>parallel::clusterEvalQ()</code> and
<code>parallel::clusterExport()</code>, as well as the examples below.
</p>
<p>The range of window sizes is specified with a slider, and represents the size as a percentage
of the shortest series' length. The <code>step</code> parameter indicates how spaced apart should the
sizes be (parameter <code>'by'</code> in <code>base::seq()</code>). A 0-size window should only be used if all series
have the same length. If the series have different lengths, using small window sizes can be
problematic if the length differences are very big, see the notes in <code>dtw_basic()</code>.
</p>
<p>A <code>window.size</code> should <em>not</em> be specified in the extra parameters, it will be replaced with the
computed values based on the slider. Using <code>dba()</code> centroid is detected, and will use the same
window sizes.
</p>
<p>For partitional clusterings with many repetitions, and hierarchical clusterings with many
linkage methods, the resulting partitions are aggregated by calling <code>clue::cl_medoid()</code> with
the specified aggregation <code>method</code>.
</p>
<p>By default, complexity of a constraint is calculated differently from what is suggested in Dau
et al. (2016):
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Allocate a logical flag vector with length equal to the number of tested window sizes.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> For each window size, set the corresponding flag to <code>TRUE</code> if the constraint given by the
user is fulfilled.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Calculate complexity as: (number of sign changes in the vector) / (number of window sizes -
1L) / (maximum number of <em>contiguous</em> <code>TRUE</code> flags).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can provide your own function in the <code>complexity</code> parameter. It will receive the flag
vector as only input, and a single number is expected as a result.
</p>
<p>The complexity threshold can be specified in the app. Any constraint whose complexity is higher
than the threshold will not be considered for the majority vote. Constraints with a complexity
of 0 are also ignored. An infinite complexity means that the constraint is never fulfilled by
any clustering.
</p>


<h3>Evaluate</h3>

<p>This section provides numerical results for reference. The latest results can be saved in the
global environment, which includes clustering results, constraints so far, and the suggested
window size. Since this includes everything returned by <code>compare_clusterings()</code>, you could also
use <code>repeat_clustering()</code> afterwards.
</p>
<p>The constraint plots depict if the constraints are fulfilled or not for the given window sizes,
where 1 means it was fulfilled and 0 means it wasn't. An error about a zero-dimension viewport
indicates the plot height is too small to fit the plots, so please increase the height.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The optimization mentioned in section 3.4 of Dau et al. (2016) is also implemented here.
</p>
<p>Tracing is printed to the console.
