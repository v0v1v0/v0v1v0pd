<h2>Determines If And How Extensively Two Date Ranges Overlap

</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>%overlaps% determines if two date ranges overlap at all and returns a logical value.
Interval returns the number of days of the overlapping part of the
two date periods. Inspired by the eponymous SQL-functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">x %overlaps% y

Overlap(x, y)

Interval(x, y)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>range 1, vector of 2 numeric values or matrix with 2 columns, the first defining the left point the second the right point of the range.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>range 2, vector of 2 numeric values or matrix with 2 columns, the first defining the left point the second the right point of the range.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>%overlaps%</code> returns <code>TRUE</code> or <code>FALSE</code> depending on if the two ranges overlap. The function <code>Overlap</code> returns the range of the overlapping region as numeric value. This will be 0, if the ranges do not overlap. <br><code>Interval</code> returns the width of the empty space between 2 ranges. Again this will be 0 if the ranges overlap.
</p>
<p>To handle overlapping ranges there are 4 cases to consider:
</p>
<pre>
range a:     |--------------|
range b:  |-----|
range c:              |--------|
range d:           |-----|
          1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8</pre>
<p>Ranges a and b overlap, the function <code>Overlap</code> will return the absolute value of the overlapping region (which will be 3 - 2 = 1 in this case). The result will be the same for <code>Overlap(a, b)</code> and <code>Overlap(b, a)</code>.<br><code>Interval</code> will have a direction. Ranges b and c do not overlap, <code>Overlap</code> will return 0, <code>%overlaps%</code> FALSE. <code>Interval</code> will return 2 for the case <code>Interval(a, b)</code> and -2 for <code>Interval(b, a)</code>.
</p>
<p>This functions can be of value, if one has to decide, whether confidence intervals overlap or not.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p> returns a logical vector (match or not for each element of x). <br>
Interval and Overlap return a numeric vector.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">as.Date(c("2012-01-03", "2012-02-03")) %overlaps%
  as.Date(c("2012-03-01", "2012-03-03"))
as.Date(c("2012-01-03", "2012-02-03")) %overlaps%
  as.Date(c("2012-01-15", "2012-01-21"))

Interval(as.Date(c("2012-01-03", "2012-02-03")), as.Date(c("2012-03-01", "2012-03-03")))


# both ranges are recyled if necessary
as.Date("2012-01-03") %overlaps% as.Date(c("2012-03-01", "2012-03-03"))

# works with numerics as well
c(1, 18) %overlaps% c(10, 45)
