<h2>Assign an individual of unknown provenance to population based on PCA</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This script assigns an individual of unknown provenance to one or more target
populations based on its proximity to each population defined by a
confidence ellipse in ordinated space of two dimensions.
</p>
<p>The following process is followed:
</p>

<ol><li>
<p> The space defined by the loci is ordinated to yield a series of
orthogonal axes (independent), and the top two dimensions are considered.
Populations for which the unknown lies outside the specified confidence
limits are no longer removed from the dataset.
</p>
</li></ol>
<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gl.assign.pca(x, unknown, plevel = 0.999, plot.out = TRUE, verbose = NULL)

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>There are three considerations to assignment. First, consider only those
populations for which the unknown has no private alleles. Private alleles are
an indication that the unknown does not belong to a target population
(provided that the sample size is adequate, say &gt;=10). This can be evaluated
with gl.assign.pa().
</p>
<p>A next step is to consider the PCoA plot for populations where no private
alleles have been detected and the position of the unknown in relation to the
confidence ellipses as is plotted by this script. Note, this plot is
considering only the top two dimensions of the ordination, and so an unknown
lying outside the confidence ellipse can be unambiguously interpreted as it 
lying outside the confidence envelope. However, if the unknown lies inside 
the confidence ellipse in two dimensions, then it may still lie outside the 
confidence envelope in deeper dimensions. This second step is good for 
eliminating populations from consideration, but does not provide confidence 
in assignment.
</p>
<p>The third step is to consider the assignment probabilities, using the script
gl.assign.mahalanobis(). This approach calculates the squared Generalised 
Linear Distance (Mahalanobis distance) of the unknown from the centroid 
for each population, and calculates the probability associated with its 
quantile under the zero truncated normal distribution. This index takes 
into account position of the unknown in relation to the confidence envelope 
in all selected dimensions of the ordination. 
</p>
<p>Each of these approaches provides evidence, none are 100
need to be interpreted cautiously. They are best applied sequentially.
</p>
<p>In deciding the assignment, the script considers an individual to be an
outlier with respect to a particular population at alpha = 0.001 as default.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A genlight object containing only those populations that are
putative source populations for the unknown individual.
