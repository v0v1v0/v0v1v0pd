<h2>Calculate Total XP of Monsters for Given Party Level and Difficulty</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Returns the total XP (experience points) of all creatures that would make an encounter the specified level of difficulty for a party of the supplied level. This 'pool' can be used by a GM (game master) to "purchase" monsters to identify how many a party is likely to be able to handle given their average level. NOTE: this does not take into account creature-specific abilities or traits so care should be taken if a monster has many such traits that modify its difficulty beyond its experience point value.
</p>
