<h3>Details</h3>


<p>Snapper is a phylogenetic approach implemented in Beauti/BEAST that can
handle larger SNP datasets than can SNAPP. This script produces a nexus file 
for Beauti which allows options to be set and creates the xml file for BEAST.
</p>
<p>Although improved over SNAPP in terms of computational efficiency,
Snapper remains constrained by computational times, even when implemented on high
performance computers with parallel processing. Computation time of Snapper 
is not particularly sensitive to the number of individuals in each terminal 
taxon (= population), but is impacted by the number of populations and the 
numbers of loci. 
</p>
<p>Particular attention needs to be directed at amalgamating populations
where their joint taxonomic identity is without question and reducing the 
number of SNP loci by prudent filtering. Removing monomorphic loci, increasing
the reliability of loci (read depth, reproducibility), minimizing missing data
(call rate), removing multiple SNPs in a single sequence tag (secondaries) 
are all good options. You may wish also to remove SNP loci that are polymorphic
within only a single population (autapomorphies) are all options for reducing the 
number of loci (rm.autapomorphies=TRUE)
</p>
<p>If computational time is still an issue (say requiring one month for a single run),
following strategy is recommended. First, subsample the loci to say 100 and test the process to ensure
there are no syntax or other issues (nloc=100). You do not want to wait several days or weeks running
the full dataset to discover a simple syntax error or incorrectly specified parameter. 
Second consider running BEAST on a platform that allows multi-threading as this will
dramatically reduce compute time. Note that adding threads does not always improve
computational time. The optimal number of threads depends on the particular analysis.
This means you have to experiment to find out how many threads give the best
performance foa a computer cycle.
</p>
<p>Also, there is an overheads cost in using many threads. Instead, you could run independent 
snapper analyses and combine resulting log and tree files. For example, if the optimal number of threads is 8 
(adding more threads reduces speed), but 8 threads gives marginal improvement over 4 threads, you can run 2 
chains with 4 threads each instead and (after getting through burn-in) then combine results and get a better result than running a 
single chain at 8 threads. A bonus benefit from running multiple chains is that you can verify that the MCMC ends up with the same 
posterior distribution each time.
</p>
<p>If computational time is still an issue, run the #'analysis on a series of subsamples of loci 
(say nloc=300) to see if a consistent topology is obtained,
then adopt that topology as the final result.
</p>
<p>Note that there is a cost to manipulating your data to achieve reasonable
computation times. Omission of sequence tags that are invariant during the SNP calling 
process, removal of monomorphic loci generated during taxon selection, and removing
autapomorphic loci will all affect branch lengths, perhaps differentially, and so 
compromise branch lengths and estimates of divergence times. Fortunately, the topology should be little affected.
</p>
<p>Finally, the analysis relies on certain assumptions. First is that the structure is one of a
bifurcating tree and not a network. One needs to assign individuals to populations in advance
of the analysis, confident that they are discrete entities and free of horizontal 
transfer. A second assumption is that the loci scored for SNPs are assorting 
independently. This is probably a reasonable assumption for
SNPs derived from sparse representational sampling (e.g. DArT), but if dense SNP arrays are being
used, then some form of thinning will be required. Of course, multiple SNPs on a single
sequence tag will be linked, so filtering all but one SNP per sequence tag is required
(gl.filter.secondaries).
</p>
<p>The workflow is
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> "1" Execute gl2snapper()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "2" Install beast2
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "3" Run beauti in the beast2 bin
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "4" Set the template to snapper [File | Template | Snapper]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "5" Load the nexus file produced by gl2snapper()
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "6" Select and set the parameters you consider appropriate
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "7" Save the xml file [File | Save As]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "8" Run beast
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "9" Load the xml file and execute
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "10" When beast is finished, examine the diagnostics with Tracer
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> "11" Visualize the resultant trees using DensiTree and FigTree. 
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If using the command line to run beast, the command is beast -threads myxmlfile. Progress can be monitored
with awk (awk '{print $1, $2}' snapper.log |tail). When beast is finished, transfer the log and tree
files to a windows platform and use Tracer, DensiTree and FigTree as above.
</p>
<p>gl2snapper does not work with SilicoDArT data.
