<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Graphical methods for compactly 
illustrating and comparing distributions, particularly distributions arising from parameter
estimation or prediction.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>denstrip</code> implements the <em>density strip</em> for
illustrating a single univariate distribution.  The darkness of the
density strip at a point is proportional to the density at that point. 
A shortcut function <code>denstrip.normal</code> draws the strip for the
given normal distribution. 
</p>
<p><code>densregion</code> implements the <em>density region</em>, which
illustrates the uncertainty surrounding a continuously-varying quantity
as a two-dimensional shaded region with darkness proportional to the
density.  There are shortcut functions <code>densregion.normal</code>
and <code>densregion.survfit</code> for computing and drawing the
region for normally-distributed predictions and survival curves,
respectively.
</p>
<p><code>sectioned.density</code> implements the <em>sectioned density plots</em>
of Cohen and Cohen (2006).  These illustrate distributions using
occlusion and varying shading.  They were developed for
summarising data, but can also be used for illustrating known
distributions.
</p>
<p><code>vwstrip</code> can be used to draw <em>varying-width strips</em> to
illustrate distributions, in a similar manner to the <em>violin plot</em> for
summarising data. The width of the strip is proportional to the density.
A shortcut function <code>vwstrip.normal</code> draws the strip for the
given normal distribution. 
</p>
<p><code>bpstrip</code> adapts the <em>box-percentile plot</em> to illustrate a
distribution instead of observed data.  This strip has width
proportional to the probability of a more extreme point.
</p>
<p><code>cistrip</code> implements the popular point and line figure for
illustrating point and interval estimates, for example from multiple
regression. 
</p>
<p>These methods are discussed in more detail by Jackson (2008).
</p>
<p>Each function is designed to add a graphic to an existing set of plot
axes. The plots can be added to either base graphics or <span class="pkg">lattice</span>
panels.
