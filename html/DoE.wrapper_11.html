<h2> Function for creating D-optimal designs with or without blocking from package AlgDesign </h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function for comfortably creating a D-optimal design with or without blocking 
based on functions optFederov or optBlock from package AlgDesign;
this functionality is still somewhat experimental.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Dopt.design(nruns, data=NULL, formula=~., factor.names=NULL, nlevels=NULL, 
    digits=NULL, constraint=NULL, center=FALSE, nRepeats=5, seed=NULL, randomize=TRUE, 
    blocks=1, block.name="Blocks", wholeBlockData=NULL, qual=NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>formula</code></td>
<td>
<p> a model formula (starting with a tilde), 
for the estimation of which a D-optimal design is sought;<br>
it can contain all column names from <code>data</code> 
or elements or element names from <code>factor.names</code>, respectively;<br>
usage of the “.”-notation for “all variables” from <code>data</code> or <code>factor.names</code> 
is possible. <br>
The default formula linearly includes all main effects for columns of <code>data</code> or factors from 
<code>factor.names</code> respectively, by using the “.”-notation. 
Note that the variables from <code>wholeBlockData</code> must be explicitly included into the formula 
and are not covered by the “.”-notation for “all variables”. (Thus, the default formula 
does not work, if <code>wholeBlockData</code> is used.)
For quantitative factors, functions <code>quad()</code> and <code>cubic</code> describe the 
full quadratic or full cubic model in the listed variables (cf. examples 
and the <code>expand.formula</code>-function from package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>).  
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>factor.names</code></td>
<td>
<p> is used for creating a candidate set (for the within Block factors)

<code>fac.design</code>, if <code>data</code> is not specified. It is a 
list of vectors which contain<br>
- individual levels<br>
- or (in case of numerical values combined with nlevels) lower and upper scale end values <br>
for each factor.<br>
The element names are used as variable names; <br>
if the list is not named, the variable names are A, B and so forth (from function 
<code>fac.design</code>).<br><code>factor.names</code> can also be a character vector. 
In this case, <code>nlevels</code> must be specified, and levels are automatically assigned 
as integers starting with 1, which implies quantitative factors, 
unless <code>qual=TRUE</code> is specified.

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>nlevels</code></td>

<p> can be omitted if the list <code>factor.names</code> explicitly 
lists all factor levels (which of course defines the number of levels).<br> 
For numeric factors for which <code>factor.names</code> only specifies the 
two scale ends, these are filled with equally-spaced intermediate points, 
using the nlevels entry as the <code>length.out</code> argument to function 
<code>seq</code>.<br> 
If <code>factor.names</code> is a character vector of factor names only, 
<code>nlevels</code> is required, and default levels are created.

<p> is used for creating a candidate set if <code>data</code> is not specified.<br> 
It specifies the digits to which numeric design columns are rounded in case of

you have to change the RNGkind setting by<br><code>RNGkind(sample.kind="Rounding")</code><br>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Function <code>Dopt.design</code> creates a D-optimal design, optionally with blocking, 
and even as a split-plot design. If no blocks are required, calculations are carried 
out through function <code>optFederov</code> from package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>. 
In case of blocked designs, function <code>optBlock</code> from package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span> 
is behind the calculations. By specifying <code>wholeBlockData</code>, a blocked design becomes 
a split-plot design. The model formula can refer to both the within block data (only those 
are referred to by the “.” notation) and the whole block data and interactions between both. <br>
In comparison to direct usage of package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>, the function adds the possibility 
of automatically creating the candidate points on the fly, with or without constraints.
Furthermore, it embeds the D-optimal designs into the class <code>design</code>. 
On the other hand, it sacrifices some of <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>s flexibility; of course, users 
can still use <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span> directly. <br></p>
<p>The D-optimal designs are particularly useful, if the classical regular designs are too demanding 
in run size requirements, or if constraints preclude automatic generation of orthogonal designs. 
Note, however, that the best design in few runs can still be very bad in absolute terms!
</p>
<p>When specifying the design without the <code>data</code> option, a full factorial in the 
requested factors is the default candidate set of design points. For some situations - especially 
with many factors - it may be better to start from a restricted candidate set. Such a candidate set 
can be produced with another R function, e.g. <code>oa.design</code> or <code>FrF2</code>, 
or can be manually created. 
</p>
<p>If there are doubts, whether the process has delivered a design close to the absolute optimum, 
<code>nRepeats</code> can be increased.
</p>
<p>For unblocked designs, it is additionally possible to increase <code>maxIteration</code>. 
Also, improving the starting 
value by <code>nullify=1</code> or <code>nullify=2</code> may lead to an improved design. 
These options are handed through to function <code>optFederov</code> 
from package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span> and are documented there.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a data frame of S3 class <code>design</code> 
with attributes attached. 
The data frame contains the experimental settings.
The matrix <code>desnum</code> attached as attribute <code>desnum</code> contains the 
model matrix of the design, using the formula as specified in the call. <br>
Function <code>Dopt.augment</code> preserves additional variables (e.g. responses) that 
have been added to the design <code>design</code> before augmenting. Note, however, that 
the response data are NOT used in deciding about which points to augment the design with.
</p>
<p>The attribute <code>run.order</code> provides the run number in standard order (as returned from 
function <code>optFederov</code> in package <span class="pkg">AlgDesign</span>) as well 
as the randomized actual run order. The third column is always identical to the first.
</p>
<p>The attribute <code>design.info</code> is a list of various design properties, with type resolving to “Dopt”, 
“Dopt.blocked”, “Dopt.splitplot”. 
In addition to the standard list elements (cf. <code>design</code>), the element 
<code>quantitative</code> is a vector of <code>nfactor</code> logical values or NAs, 
and the optional <code>digits</code> elements indicates the number of digits to 
which the data were rounded. 
For blocked and splitplot designs, the list contains additional information on numbers and sizes of blocks or plots, 
as well as the number of whole plot factors (which are always the first few factors) and split-plot factors.<br>
The list contains a list of optimality criteria as calculated by function <code>optFederov</code>, 
see documentation there) 
with elements <code>D</code>, <code>Dea</code>, <code>A</code> and <code>G</code>. 
</p>
<p>(Note that <code>replications</code> is always 1 and <code>repeat.only</code> is always FALSE; 
these elements are only present to fulfill the formal requirements for class <code>design</code>.
Note however, that blocked designs do in fact repeat experimental runs if <code>nruns</code> and <code>blocks</code>
imply this.)
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Since R version 3.6.0, the behavior of function <code>sample</code> has changed 
(correction of a biased previous behavior that should not be relevant for the randomization of designs). 
For reproducing a design that was produced with an earlier R version, 
please follow the steps described with the argument <code>seed</code>.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p> This package is still under (slow) development. Reports about bugs and inconveniences are welcome.</p>
