<h2>Diameter growth increments of a tropical tree species in Hawaii</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Tree size, competition, and diameter growth increment of Metrosideros polymorpha trees
collected in the Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii. Data containing 64 observations at the current annual growth 
rate (defined as dbh increment within one calendar year) of each tree
was measured from 1986 to 1988 using band dendrometers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(hawaii)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The dataframe has the following columns:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>tree.code</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tree number identification. The first letter of the ID represents
a cohort. Six cohorts representing a chronosequence were sampled.</p>
</dd>
<dt>dbh</dt>
<dd>
<p>Initial stem diameter, in cm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>toth</dt>
<dd>
<p>Total height, in m.</p>
</dd>
<dt>crown.area</dt>
<dd>
<p>Crown outline area, in square meters.</p>
</dd>
<dt>comp.ind</dt>
<dd>
<p>Competition index (Basal area of nearest neighbor divided by square of distance to nearest neighbor plus
basal area of second nearest neighbor divided by square of distance to second nearest neighbor).</p>
</dd>
<dt>cai.1986</dt>
<dd>
<p>Current annual stem diameter increment during 1986, in mm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cai.1987</dt>
<dd>
<p>Current annual stem diameter increment during 1987, in mm.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cai.1988</dt>
<dd>
<p>Current annual stem diameter increment during 1988, in mm.</p>
</dd>
