<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In cluster-randomized trials (CRTs), matching is a technique that can be used to improve
covariate balance. Matching protects against chance imbalances in baseline covariate distributions and is
thought to improve study credibility. Matching is also implemented to increase study power. Pairs of similar
clusters are formed and then one cluster from the pair is randomized to group 1 while the other is assigned
to group 2. Now we are going to determine the number of cluster in each group.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# (a) Comparison of means:

# This is a matched cluster randomized trials. The type ="M" indicates the comparison of
# means. The mean responses of a test group is mu1 = 0.06 and a reference group is mur =
# 0.4. The standard deviationof within cluster and between  cluster are sig.w = 0.69 and
# sig.bm = 0.224 respectively, m = 20 indicates number of subject in each cluster. alpha
# =.05 is the level of significance and the probability of type-II error is beta = 0.10.


crt.match(type="M",mu1=0.6,mu2=0.4,alpha=0.05,beta=0.20,sig.w=0.69,sig.bm=0.224,m=20)


# (b) Comparison of proportions:

# This is a matched  cluster randomized trials. Where type = "P" indicates the tests for
# comparison of proportions. The proportion of a test group is mu1 =0.01 and a reference
# group is mur = 0.0075. The Standard deviation of between cluster is sig.bm=0.224 and m
# = 2750 indicates number of subject in each cluster, alpha = 0.05 is the level of signi
# -ficance and probability of type-II error is beta = 0.10.


crt.match(type="P",mu1=0.01,mu2=0.0075,alpha=0.05,beta=0.10,sig.bm=0.0075,m=2750)


#(c) Comparison of incidence rates:

# This is a matched cluster randomized trials. Where type = "IR" indicates the tests the
# comparison of incidence rates. The incidence rate of a test group is mu1 = 4.5 and for
# reference group is mur = 3.6. A total of m = 50 person years is considered, alpha =.05
# is the level ofsignificance and the probability of type-II error is beta = 0.10. k=0.3
# indicates the common value of the coefficient of variation for each group.


crt.match(type="IR",mu1=4.5,mu2=3.6,alpha=0.05,beta=0.20,m=50,k=0.3)
